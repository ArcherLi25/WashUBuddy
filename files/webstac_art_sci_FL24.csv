3,L90 AFAS 144,First-Year Seminar: Monumental Anti-Racism,3.0 Units,"As sources of national memory and identity, public monuments, place names, historical markers, and other elements of commemorative landscapes are potential sites of cultural violence (e.g., alienation, disrespect, and erasure) contributing to broader conflict and inequality, and therefore important considerations in movements for equal opportunity and justice. Some contend that memory sites are ""the new lunch counters,"" where our racial politics are worked out. This course examines the racial politics of commemorative objects and practices, and commemorative intervention as a strategy of anti-racist activism. We begin with an historical survey of various ways that racism has been inscribed on the commemorative landscape, and readings in history, political theory, cultural studies, and other fields to gain insight on these contested commemorative objects, their development, and social significance. We then turn to a critical assessment of efforts to remove and recontextualize commemorative objects, and to erect new objects commemorating neglected figures and issues. We consider how these reparative efforts relate to what political theorists call remedies of recognition, and specifically how they might aid in advancing equal opportunity and justice. Through our study and engagement with contested commemorative landscapes, including local, national, and global cases, students will become familiar with the burgeoning interdisciplinary field of memory studies, diverse forms and sites of commemoration, local and global efforts to advance what has been termed ""commemorative justice,"" and challenges they face.",HUM SC ,HUM ,CPSC HUM ,H ,BA ,01,---R---,3:00P-5:50P,TBA,Ward,Paper/Project/TakeHome,15,0,0

A year prior, Brazil introduced a quota system for all federal jobs, leading to new questions about who qualifies for these positions. These examples and more highlight a new era in Latin America that questions who counts -- both literally as with censuses and figuratively as with affirmative action -- as Afro-descended in a region characterized by racial mixture. In this course, we will analyze the new turn toward racial governance as we grapple with the following questions: How does the racial governance of the 21st century upend or echo the racial governance of the colonial era?

Starting with the images of enslavement and freedom in the form of painting, sketches, prints, daguerrotypes, and other early photographs in nineteenth-century Latin America, we will explore how the camera has marked the passing of time and created racial histories-actual and fictional-that educate us, move us, and influence how governments make policy. We will view an array of films, video, and still photography, across multiple genres, that center the histories and present-day joys and struggles of black people in Latin America while actively considering how our own consumption of media informs our racial perceptions of Latin America. The work that we view and read about will be used to question Latin America's perceived racial exceptionalism narratives, such as mestizaje, mulatismo, and racial democracy, and how they depend on sugarcoated histories of race mixture during slavery and colonization. This course will also focus heavily on how image-making becomes a persuasive means to make one's blackness known in the framework of the Latin America nation-state, to stake claims to rights, and to document black life in productive, pleasurable ways that do not always center the ongoing gentrification, annihilation, and genocide of black communities.",HUM LCD SC ,HUM ,HUM VC ,H ,BA ETH ,01,M-W----,2:30P-3:50P,TBA,Mundell,Paper,15,0,0

The first ""talking film,"" Al Jolson's The Jazz Singer contained the (in)famous song, ""Mammie,"" which was sung by Mr. Jolson in Black Face, a carry-over from White performers who darkened their faces with burned cork during minstrel and vaudeville live performances. Those early films were produced and directed by European Americans who tended to portray African Americans through negative sterotypical depictions. Gradually, with the passage of time, technology, and the emergence of the Civil Rights Movement, a combination of European and African American film makers began to provide a broader array of Black portrayals that included a spectrum of negative to positive depictions of Black people.

In this course, we delve into this long process of interaction between France and its colonies of Africa. During the first half of the semester, we explore these historical relationships and examine the scientific constructs of race in the 19th and early 20th century. We touch on themes that defined the colonial encounter, including the development of the Four Communes in Senegal, the Negritude movement, and French Islamic policies in Africa. The curriculum for this course includes articles, films, and monographs, to explore these themes and includes writers and social activists living in France and the African diaspora. The second half of the course examines Francophone Africa after independence. Here the course explores the political and cultural (inter) dependence between France and its Francophone African partners.

15,L90 AFAS 3120,African Immigration to the United States of America,3.0 Units,"The United States of America has historically been known as a ""nation of immigrants."" However, current rhetoric has brought this notion into question. This country has consistently been a magnet for millions of people from all over the world, and this course seeks broadly to understand recent African immigration. In Black studies, most attention has been paid to the forced migration of the enslaved during the Atlantic Slave trade. Studying 20th and 21st African immigration is key to truly understanding the Black experience in America. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, 2.1 million Africans live in America as of 2015. The majority of these migrants are from Sub-Saharan Anglophone Africa (Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa), but they are also from war-torn countries such as Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia. The primary focus of this course will be on contemporary African labor immigrants, including skilled professionals, children who arrived in the United States for family reunification, refugees, and winners of the Diversity Visa lottery who are now permanent residents. The migratory flux also includes people who were forced to leave their birth countries for political reasons as well as genocide. Through the class, we will examine the ""push and pull"" factors of immigration. The second part of the course explores the lived experience of Africans in America, whether they are well educated as compared with other migrant communities or whether they are laborers. We will study the role of remittances, language barriers, paths to naturalization, and job opportunities once Africans reach American soil. Increasingly, repatriation (both voluntarily and forced), xenophobia and Islamophobia are challenges that rock African immigrant communities. Today, many Africans live between two countries: Africa and America. This transnationalism allows them to navigate different lives, stories, identities, and cultures. Several activities are organized in the African local community. There is a large group of Ghanaians, Kenyans, Egyptians, Senegalese, Nigerians, Ethiopians, and Somalians in St. Louis. We will invite these individuals to the class as guest speakers so that students can fully understand their multiple lives in the St. Louis metropolitan area.",HUM LCD SC ,HUM ,HUM ,H ,BA IS ,01,-T-R---,4:00P-5:20P,TBA,DIALLO,Paper/Project/TakeHome,19,0,0

What does it mean to be a 'typical' Karen in Internet culture? What are the aesthetic boundaries of Karens? And, what do digital platforms afford to Black users who make Karens visible?

19,L90 AFAS 3655,Black Conservatives and Their Discontent: African Americans and Conservatism in America,3.0 Units,"In this course, we will examine the attraction of some African Americans to the ideas and aims of conservatism: limited government, individual freedom, the objectivity of merit, religious tradition, self-reliance, and a free market economy. On the matter of race, African Americans who identify as conservatives tend to be strongly opposed to affirmative action, to distrust race-based public policy solutions and government intervention in race issues generally, to opposed to reparations for slavery, and to believe in character-building and values such as thrift and hard work as important virtues for Blacks to cultivate. Their hostility toward liberalism and leftist ideology is not quite the same as some religious-based Black conservatives, such as the racially militant Nation of Islam and the several black Pentecostal sects, who strenuously believe that white liberalism and white leftist thought are expressions of white decadence. However, their beliefs are not far removed from this. In this way, Black conservatives aBre seen in a harshly antagonistic way by the national lack political establishment, which is largely liberal, and by black intellectuals and scholars, who are, for the most part, leftist-leaning. The critics of Black conservatism cannot understand how some Black people can be attracted to ideas that are rooted in racist assumptions, that are justifications for white domination, and that have been used to defend the white-dominated status quo and a white, Eurocentric value system. Race must be used as a weapon for liberation from white thralldom. What does a Black person have to conserve, and why would they want to identify with an ideology that has been used to oppress them? Black liberals and leftists call Black conservatives ""Uncle Toms"" and ""Sellouts."" Black conservatives return the antagonism in full measure, arguing that white liberals and leftists use the victimology of Blacks as a cudgel to beat whites with whom they politically disagree in order to effect the social change they desire and that they treat Blacks essentially as injured children who need to be either indulged, romanticized, excused, aided, or pitied. Racial identity is nothing more than a mere weapon of resentment. Black conservatives feel that Black liberals and leftists play into the hands of white liberals and leftists by making race an overdetermining factor in the lives of Black people. They also argue that the public policy solutions of Black liberals and leftists have not worked and that they in fact mostly benefit the Black middle class. They call civil rights leaders and Black liberal and leftist intellectuals ""race hustlers"" and ""race charlatans."" The conflict here is not simply or solely political; it is also deeply psychological and a question of identity. What does being Black mean, and what is it prohibited from meaning? We will look closely at many of the major works of significant Black conservatives to understand the nature of their arguments and their claims to legitimacy. How do Black people see conservatism? What do they hope conservatism will do for the Black community? Have they made much of an inroad among Blacks? Is it true, as some conservatives have claimed, that Blacks have a natural affinity for certain conservative ideas?

This place-based course in historic preservation pursues these questions in St. Louis' historically Black neighborhood The Ville, where deep historic significance meets a built environment conditioned by population loss, disinvestment and demolition. The course explores the practice of historic preservation as something far from neutral, but a creative, productive endeavor that mediates between community values, official policies and expert assertion.

29,L90 AFAS 4235,Blackness in Brazil,3.0 Units,"Brazil is the country with the largest population of people of African descent outside of the African continent. However, with its history of race mixture under colonialism and slavery, many have imagined Brazil as a racial paradise such that race minimally influences one's social, political, or economic quality of life. The main focus of this course will be to understand from an interdisciplinary approach, first, the historical and sociocultural conditions of the African diaspora in Brazil. Second, we will focus on how national ideologies of racial mixture employ a rhetoric of inclusion that incorporates selective aspects of black culture into Brazilian national identity while excluding black people from the protections and pleasures of full citizenship. Beginning with the experiences of enslaved Africans, we will engage how Afro-Brazilians have developed ideas and spaces of freedom and belonging through social movements, religion, the arts, and resistance well into the black consciousness movements of the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In the course, we will collaboratively read, view, and listen to a variety of primary and secondary sources in order to analyze and write about blackness and the lives of black people in Brazil across history, intersecting, most predominantly, with the social structures of gender, sexuality, class, and religion.",HUM LCD SC ,HUM ,HUM ,H ,,01,-T-----,3:00P-5:50P,TBA,Mundell,No final,15,0,0
30,L90 AFAS 423B,Topics in American Literature: James Baldwin Now,3.0 Units,"Marking the centennial of his birth in 1924, this class will examine why James Baldwin became the twentieth-century African American author most loved in the twenty-first. An inexhaustible public witness and the author of poems, plays, essays, novels, and short stories, the Harlem-born Baldwin ranks with the most daring and elegant American literary voices. His first novel, the autobiographical ""Go Tell It on the Mountain"" (1953), wrestled with the dual heritage of Black Christianity and Depression-era Black social realism. His second novel, ""Giovanni's Room"" (1956), set in Paris and peopled with non-black characters, explored the intricacies of same-sex desire years before the Stonewall rebellion announced the gay rights movement. ""Notes of a Native Son"" (1955), the first collection of Baldwin's lush and searching essays and a grandparent of twenty-first century autocriticism, is perhaps the most-tweeted book of our era. Our reading list will contain all of these books, but we'll end with a sequence of texts revealing various facets of Baldwin's resurrected meaning in the wake of Black Lives Matter: among them, Ta-Nehisi Coates's memoir ""Between the World and Me"" (2015); Raoul Peck's documentary ""I Am Not Your Negro"" (2017); and Eddie Glaude Jr.'s Trump-era treatise ""Begin Again"" (2020). Altogether, this will be a single-author course on a singular author whose life after death illuminates crucial issues in Black cultural politics in two centuries. Satisfies the Twentieth Century and later requirement. This course may fulfill the global or minority literatures requirement for students who declare an English major in the fall 2021 semester and beyond.",HUM SD ,,HUM ,H ,,01,-T-R---,1:00P-2:20P,TBA,Maxwell,No final,15,0,0
31,L90 AFAS 442,"Engineering Authority:  Design, Architecture, and Power in Africa",3.0 Units,"Do water meters have politics? Can architects manufacture consent for political repression or engage in activism? What happens when designed systems fail? Design is everywhere. It is in the water you drink; it is in the built material and digital spaces you hang out in; and it is in the chair you are sitting in. And yet, perhaps because of its ubiquity, design receives very little attention from scholars in the humanities and even less from African studies. In this course, we will examine a number of case studies, from minor architectures and ruins in Monrovia to hydraulic engineering in Johannesburg and iconic architecture in Casablanca to DIY market spaces in Nairobi and insurgent public space-making in Kinshasa. We will explore the ways that designers, architects, and technocrats engineer authority and how (sometimes) urban residents take it apart. One potential definition (among many other potential definitions) of design could be the following: the practices that humans employ to arrange, engineer, plan and fashion their material, digital, and social environments. But designs are also artifacts -- master plans, prototypes, and brands -- that occupy social lives independent of their assigned functions. Design is often about aspirations for a better world and finding technological and aesthetic solutions to social problems. Yet the products of design -- from zoning codes and service delivery networks to iconic built structures -- seem to always invite failures, disruptions, hackings, and ruination. A central argument in this course is that understanding design is also key to understanding power, inequality, and insurgency in Africa. We will draw our texts and case studies from places that are normally left off the map of design studies -- African cities and towns -- and explore the applicability of these theories to St. Louis.",SSC ,SSC ,CPSC SSC VC ,S ,BA ,01,-T-R---,11:30A-12:50P,TBA,Shearer,Paper/Project/TakeHome,15,0,0

From the nineteenth century to the present day, writers and filmmakers have revisited (and often subverted) questions that Dostoevsky's novel poses: What internal and external forces cause someone to ""step over"" into crime? What are the implications of a confession? To what extent can the legal system provide a just punishment? Are forgiveness and redemption possible, or even relevant? What role does grace--or luck--play in the entire process? This course begins with our close reading of Dostoevsky's novel and then moves on to short stories, novels, literary essays, and movies that engage in dialogue with the Russian predecessor. A central concern of our intertextual approach is to explore the interplay between specific socio-historical contexts and universal questions. All readings are in English.

541,L98 AMCS 1012,First-Year Seminar: Introduction to Urban Studies,3.0 Units,"This course provides a survey of the field of Urban Studies, utilizing the city of St. Louis as a field site. The major purpose of the course is to gradually reveal how a city operates internally, and how it operates externally with its sister cities, surrounding metropolitan areas and neighboring states, amidst competing and often contradictory interests. Utilizing historical analysis as a guide, the course will briefly revisit the experiences of previous waves of ethnic groups to the St. Louis metropolitan area, as a lens for understanding the current social, political and economic dilemmas which many urban dwellers in St. Louis now face. The course will reveal to students the intricacies of social welfare issues and policies among high density populations, in St. Louis, that are homogeneous and heterogeneous, at the same time. Visits and discussions with various governmental and nongovernmental agencies, and how such agencies function or dysfunction for various constituencies allow students to ask crucial questions regarding equality of opportunity in a democratic society. Students will also encounter diverse communities and neighborhoods and the intended and unintended consequences of social welfare policies designed to ameliorate urban dilemmas such as poverty and inequality, homelessness, educational underachievement, gentrification, migration and immigration, development, health care, fiscal issues, the informal economy, and issues concerned with crime and social justice, among others. Readings are reinforced and challenged through visits, interactions and observations with broad constituencies and institutions, ranging from city officials to community residents. As such, this course offers a survey discussion of the rich interdisciplinary field of Urban Studies for those who may be interested in pursuing a stand alone major in the field of Urban Studies.",SC SD SSC ,HT SSC ,SSC ,S ,BA ,01,--W----,2:00P-4:50P,TBA,Camp Yeakey,No final,19,0,0

562,L98 AMCS 144,First-Year Seminar: Monumental Anti-Racism,3.0 Units,"As sources of national memory and identity, public monuments, place names, historical markers, and other elements of commemorative landscapes are potential sites of cultural violence (e.g., alienation, disrespect, and erasure) contributing to broader conflict and inequality, and therefore important considerations in movements for equal opportunity and justice. Some contend that memory sites are ""the new lunch counters,"" where our racial politics are worked out. This course examines the racial politics of commemorative objects and practices, and commemorative intervention as a strategy of anti-racist activism. We begin with an historical survey of various ways that racism has been inscribed on the commemorative landscape, and readings in history, political theory, cultural studies, and other fields to gain insight on these contested commemorative objects, their development, and social significance. We then turn to a critical assessment of efforts to remove and recontextualize commemorative objects, and to erect new objects commemorating neglected figures and issues. We consider how these reparative efforts relate to what political theorists call remedies of recognition, and specifically how they might aid in advancing equal opportunity and justice.

This course teaches students how to critically analyze U.S. culture and society and introduces them to the history, methodologies, frameworks, and key questions that have shaped and continue to inform this interdisciplinary field. American culture studies is a broad and vast discipline that defies simple summary; it asks probing questions to uplift marginalized voices and experiences as part of an expansive definition of American identity. This course exposes students to practices that constitute American culture studies rather than demarcate a terrain for what it is: historically crossing disciplinary boundaries (arts, humanities, social sciences) and engaging diverse texts (film, literature, historical documents, popular culture, performance, material culture, etc.) American culture studies resists strict definition! In this course students study how knowledge and understandings about society and culture are produced and learn approaches to analyzing, curating and interpreting cultural objects and theorizing cultural phenomena. We examine the concept and idea of ""America"" in local, regional, national, and international contexts and continuums; we explore the lived experiences of diverse American communities within and across cultural and literal borders. Through a case study approach, the course engages questions related to the construction of ethnic and racial identities in the U.S.; visual, material, and digital cultures; social thought and social issues; mass media and popular culture; gender and sexuality; citizenship and nationhood; art, literature, and performance; and American imperialism.",HUM ,HUM ,HUM ,H ,BA ,01,-T-R---,11:30A-12:50P,TBA,[TBA],Paper/Project/TakeHome,19,0,0

In this course we examine the phenomenon of Islamophobia as a form of anti-Muslim racism that parallels hostility towards other religious and racial minorities in the US. We explore how while the post-9/11 context gave way to an increase in incidents of anti-Muslim violence, contemporary manifestations of Islamophobia are deeply rooted in state level anti-black racism from the early twentieth century, as well as in anti-Muslim attitudes that date back to the colonial period.

Can it do both simultaneously? Can popular artists influence politics, or is that too much to ask of them?In order to address these and other questions, we will interrogate how musicians, performers, scholars, listeners, and consumers experience, participate in and think about various music and dance practices, from slave music and minstrelsy, the blues, jazz, and rock and roll to reggae and hip hop. Historically and through the present, we will consider how African American musicians, as well as musicians and performers from other underrepresented groups, have so often been excluded from reaping the economic and political benefits of music industries, and how they have contested injustice on multiple levels. This means that our core questions ask what musical practices can reveal about relations of race, gender, class and belonging in this country.

Our goal this term is to see past the mythic articulations to understand the origins and practices of hacking cultures so we better understand how our digital commonality is engineered as a robust and enduring 'thing' where vulnerability is both feature and bug. Doing so makes visible the politics of making and unmaking, solutionism, and iterative engineering. We'll interrogate the hacker narrative construct in media to understand how we know so little about the ecosystem we depend upon.

592,L98 AMCS 3120,African Immigration to the United States of America,3.0 Units,"The United States of America has historically been known as a ""nation of immigrants."" However, current rhetoric has brought this notion into question. This country has consistently been a magnet for millions of people from all over the world, and this course seeks broadly to understand recent African immigration. In Black studies, most attention has been paid to the forced migration of the enslaved during the Atlantic Slave trade. Studying 20th and 21st African immigration is key to truly understanding the Black experience in America. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, 2.1 million Africans live in America as of 2015. The majority of these migrants are from Sub-Saharan Anglophone Africa (Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa), but they are also from war-torn countries such as Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia. The primary focus of this course will be on contemporary African labor immigrants, including skilled professionals, children who arrived in the United States for family reunification, refugees, and winners of the Diversity Visa lottery who are now permanent residents. The migratory flux also includes people who were forced to leave their birth countries for political reasons as well as genocide. Through the class, we will examine the ""push and pull"" factors of immigration. The second part of the course explores the lived experience of Africans in America, whether they are well educated as compared with other migrant communities or whether they are laborers. We will study the role of remittances, language barriers, paths to naturalization, and job opportunities once Africans reach American soil. Increasingly, repatriation (both voluntarily and forced), xenophobia and Islamophobia are challenges that rock African immigrant communities. Today, many Africans live between two countries: Africa and America. This transnationalism allows them to navigate different lives, stories, identities, and cultures. Several activities are organized in the African local community. There is a large group of Ghanaians, Kenyans, Egyptians, Senegalese, Nigerians, Ethiopians, and Somalians in St. Louis. We will invite these individuals to the class as guest speakers so that students can fully understand their multiple lives in the St. Louis metropolitan area.",HUM LCD SC ,HUM ,HUM ,H ,BA IS ,01,-T-R---,4:00P-5:20P,TBA,DIALLO,Paper/Project/TakeHome,19,0,0

Why have so many novels and films memorialized adolescence? How has the period of development been portrayed in recent American fiction? How have depictions and attitudes toward teen culture changed over the past fifty years? We will begin with J.D.

In this course, we will study Indigenous presence in St. Louis and how Indigenous geographies overlap and coexist in tension with settler-colonial geographies. While St. Louis began as a French colonial settlement, established by fur traders in 1764, the lands that the city occupied were and continue to be Native lands. What we call St. Louis was a geography shared by many Indigenous peoples. The region was a major urban center between the 11th and 14th centuries-today referred to as Cahokia. It then became a territory shared by many tribes, including Ni Okaska (Osage), Niúachi (Missouria), Illiniwek (Illinois Confederacy), and others. In the nineteenth century, some of these tribes were coerced into leaving their homelands and sent to reservations in Indian Territory (also known as Oklahoma). A century later, St. Louis was one of the urban centers where Indigenous people were relocated as part of an effort to break up tribes and the reservation system. And today Indigenous peoples from all over the continent inhabit St. Louis as a place of family, friendships, community, of livelihoods, education, and creative practices; but also, as a place of contestation, as a city structured by systems of domination, such as race and class, and Indigenous erasure. Loosely following this historical timeline, we will study how this erasure happened and engage with different sources to study St. Louis as an ongoing Indigenous place and space.",HUM SD ,HUM ,CPSC HUM ,H ,BA ,01,M-W----,1:00P-2:20P,TBA,Gill,Paper/Project/TakeHome,19,0,0

These physical and spatial boundaries often demarcate divisions between people, particularly along the dimensions of race, social class or economic status. In this class, we will examine a variety of the borders and boundaries that shape and define the St. Louis region, investigating their origins, and interrogating whether and how the distinction between fenced-off corners and the wider setting helps us to understand those boundaries-or whether that distinction reflects an outdated set of concerns and thereby limits our vision about the city and what it can be.",HUM ,HUM ,CPSC HUM ,H ,BA HUM ,01,-T-R---,8:30A-9:50A,TBA,Bartzel,Paper/Project/TakeHome,19,0,0

Global Power and Resistance,3.0 Units,"The 21st century is characterized by numerous ongoing global conflicts in Asia, Africa, Middle East, Caribbean, and The Americas. Popular opinions blame these on poor choices in ""third world countries""- dictatorships, corruption, failing economies, or the lack of people's will for change. But, can we interpret these conflicts as reactions of historical colonial incursions? Is colonialism over? Has the empire ended? This course interrogates popular opinions - through commentary, photographs, maps, personal opinions - about ongoing global conflicts to challenge the assumption that we are in a ""post"" colonial age where the era of colonialism has officially ended. Interrogating this logocentric notion, the course surveys literatures from five continents, namely: Asia, Africa, Middle East, Caribbean, and the Americas to study how current world conflicts, such as ones in Kashmir, Sudan, Palestine, Haiti, etc. have their roots in colonial politics, settler colonialism, and popular cultural instruments of colonialism, such as, religion, language, holidays, tourism, and other colonial vestiges. Utilizing transnational, decolonial, antiracist, and humanitarian frameworks, the course interrogates how the logocentric approach that officially ends colonialism, in effect erases historical knowledge, and doubly impugns people historically marginalized by their colonial encounters.",HUM ,HUM ,HUM ,H ,BA ,01,M-W----,10:00A-11:20A,Seigle / 304   ,Ghosh,Paper/Project/TakeHome,20,0,0

But while these statistics themselves are relatively uncontroversial, their meanings are not. American bodies are politically embattled: debates about belonging, identity, power, personal and collective responsibility, and what constitutes a good or aspirational life play out in and as discourses about the state of bodies and the provenance of their ills. American bodies are in many ways diverse - but they are also conditioned by broadly shared (but unevenly distributed) exposure to a unique constellation of infra/structural, environmental, and social determinants of health. In this course, we will read broadly across disciplines in order to survey the conditions that shape American bodies, and consider how bodies and their un/healthy status come to speak in cultural and political discourse.",SSC ,SSC ,SSC ,S ,BA IS ,01,-T-R---,10:00A-11:20A,TBA,Nilsson,Paper/Project/TakeHome,18,0,0

What is the equality/difference debate about and why is it important for feminists?

Students will explore the relationships among local communities, wider historical and economic processes, and theoretical approaches to disease, the body, ethnicity/race, gender, sexuality, risk, addiction, power, and culture. Other topics covered include the cultural construction of AIDS and risk, government responses to HIV/AIDS, origin and transmission debates, ethics and responsibilities, drug testing and marketing, the making of the AIDS industry and ""risk"" categories, prevention and education strategies, interactions between biomedicine and alternative healing systems, and medical advances and hopes.",LCD SC SD SSC ,SSC ,SSC ,S ,IS ,01,-T-R---,11:30A-12:50P,TBA,Parikh,Dec 16 2024  1:00PM -  3:00PM,200,0,0

Does the choice to preserve buildings, landscapes and places belong to government, experts or ordinary people? How does the condition of the built environment impact community identity, structure and success? This place-based course in historic preservation pursues these questions in St. Louis' historically Black neighborhood The Ville, where deep historic significance meets a built environment conditioned by population loss, disinvestment and demolition. The course explores the practice of historic preservation as something far from neutral, but a creative, productive endeavor that mediates between community values, official policies and expert assertion.

645,L98 AMCS 423,Topics in American Literature: James Baldwin Now,3.0 Units,"Marking the centennial of his birth in 1924, this class will examine why James Baldwin became the twentieth-century African American author most loved in the twenty-first. An inexhaustible public witness and the author of poems, plays, essays, novels, and short stories, the Harlem-born Baldwin ranks with the most daring and elegant American literary voices. His first novel, the autobiographical ""Go Tell It on the Mountain"" (1953), wrestled with the dual heritage of Black Christianity and Depression-era Black social realism. His second novel, ""Giovanni's Room"" (1956), set in Paris and peopled with non-black characters, explored the intricacies of same-sex desire years before the Stonewall rebellion announced the gay rights movement. ""Notes of a Native Son"" (1955), the first collection of Baldwin's lush and searching essays and a grandparent of twenty-first century autocriticism, is perhaps the most-tweeted book of our era. Our reading list will contain all of these books, but we'll end with a sequence of texts revealing various facets of Baldwin's resurrected meaning in the wake of Black Lives Matter: among them, Ta-Nehisi Coates's memoir ""Between the World and Me"" (2015); Raoul Peck's documentary ""I Am Not Your Negro"" (2017); and Eddie Glaude Jr.'s Trump-era treatise ""Begin Again"" (2020). Altogether, this will be a single-author course on a singular author whose life after death illuminates crucial issues in Black cultural politics in two centuries.

The class has four parts. We begin the course by weighing the concept of identity and different forms and venues in which it shapes political engagement. We follow this segment with a look at the mobilization of ultra-nationalist politics in domestic and international settings in order to understand the different social and political threads associated with nationalist identities. We then turn to exploring the more widely cited theories that explain the mechanics of political mobilization and movements. Finally, we look at a series of politically engaged groups that have strong identity elements in order to assess their similarities and differences domestically and internationally across the 21st century.

It is a system through which tens of millions of students pass each year; over the last few decades, the importance of earning a postsecondary credential has increased markedly. As such, higher education is deserving of rigorous scrutiny and careful interrogation. But in studying ""higher education,"" we are in fact attending to a multitude of things - among other things, varied institutional types with different resources and different imperatives, experiences of accessing and navigating higher education that are widely divergent along axes of inequality, and institutional processes that play out on campus but have resonance beyond the university gates. In this course, which will be conducted as a discussion-based seminar, we will engage with texts examining the enterprise of higher education from varied vantage points, but always through a sociological lens. We'll discuss why and how higher education came to be so important and loom so large in contemporary life, the stark differences between different sectors of the higher education landscape, and how stratification occurs between and within institutions. We'll talk at length about how higher education is a microcosm of many of the inequalities we see in the broader society, looking at issues of race, class, gender, and politics on campus. By taking a sociological lens to studying higher education, we'll learn a language and facility for rooting discussion of issues in higher education in theoretical grounding and empirical evidence.

We will study how forces -- such as de facto segregation, the disproportionate hyper-disciplining of students, punitive school climates, and the devaluing of certain forms of cultural and social capital -- can contribute to cycles of social reproduction among the marginalized. To address such challenges, this course introduces sociocultural theories and critical qualitative inquiry methods as mechanisms by which urban educational institutions can be positively transformed. Specifically, restorative practices, cogenerative dialogues, and participatory/co-researcher models are explored as methods that honor the voices of marginalized stakeholders and lead to catalytic, transformational impact. Leaving this course, students will have an understanding of the inequitable terrain of urban education institutions as well as a repertoire of theories and methods to assist with the conducting of critically grounded, culturally responsive, humane, and transformative research.

This course considers politics across time, space, and individuals, noting how historical, geographical, cultural, social, psychological, political, and economic contexts can shape the politics of education. In addition, as this course considers the relationship between politics and power, we explore how politics can manifest itself in ways that promote exclusion and subjugation or work toward the common good.

The Mexico-US Relationship in Mexican History and Culture,3.0 Units,"From the 19th century onwards, the relationship between Mexico and the United States has been defined by intense tensions and contradictions. Closely intertwined by geopolitical engagement and integrations, mutual migration flows, and rich cultural exchange, both countries belong to a binational system with few equivalents around the world, which defines the lives of people living across North America. And yet, few people in the United States have access to a clear and rigorous understanding of the Southern neighbor, often leading to conflict at the political and social levels. This class explores this historically, from the early frictions caused by territory and slavery to the binational conditions of the present. The class emphasizes the Mexican perspective of the relationship, often erased in discussions from the U.S. From this perspective, the course will engage critical moments in the history of the relationships, such as the underground railroad to the South, the Mexican American War, the Guadalupe Hidalgo treaty, and the Cold War. The class will also discuss the ways in which Mexico has influenced the United States culturally, from the impact of Mexican post-Revolutionary art in the New Deal to the rise of film directors like Alfonso Cuarón and Gullermo del Toro.

The course explores New York City's ambivalent relationship with America, with the world, and with itself. It focuses on matters of power - how, in different moments of the city's history, it was defined, who held it, and how various groups managed to contest for it; matters of exchange and extraction - political, cultural, and economic; and matters of belonging - whether a city of immigrants, exiles and refugees succeeded in becoming a home for the homeless. It pays close attention to both the micro - the street corner and the political ward; the bridge and the tunnel; the gentrifying neighborhood; the mosaic of the city's foodways; the theater, financial, slaughterhouse, brothel, and other districts - and the macro - the banks and the stock exchange; the port and transit authorities; the instrumentalities of knowledge and cultural production in the city's universities, print media, clubs, and salons; the sports empires; and the political machines, organized crime, grassroots labor and political movements, insurgencies, and undergrounds. Above all, the course will foreground the city's massive and unbearable contradictions, as a city of skyscrapers and of basement dives, lures, and snares; as a symbol of the future and freedom bound to traumatic, slave, and unfree pasts; as a symbol of modern independence bound to modern interdependence; and as a place of renaissances and ruinations, where the world either comes together or spectacularly falls apart.

How can research translate into opportunities beyond the classroom, from service to politics? In this workshop AMCS Majors explore these questions while receiving support at a crucial milestone, the Senior Capstone. Through reflection and writing students develop a stronger intellectual identity, and consider how their research prepares them to participate in conversations and activities that transcend scholarship. This participation is a kind of ""academic citizenship"" with students leveraging their learning to engage intellectual, social, and political life in and beyond campus. Students do this primarily through consideration of their capstone research, happening concurrently in the AMCS Capstone Workshop or in an approved seminar. While encouraging Majors to consider the intersection of their academic and personal goals, the workshop supports research (e.g., guest faculty discuss methodology), gives structure to activities already required for the Major (e.g., the capstone abstract), and builds community (e.g., peer-led discussions). The workshop also provides time and space for students to curate their AMCS portfolio. The Fall Workshop is part of a workshop series designed to help AMCS Majors develop their portfolio and provide additional training and support at particular milestones in the major. The portfolio and accompanying workshops is a response to students' feedback. Graduating seniors said they would have liked more structured time to reflect on their work in the major; they would have liked to document their progress in the program more fully; and they wanted more opportunities to strengthen their class cohort.

What is to be done with the commemorative landscape of monuments and memorials? How do we account for the silences and erasures in archival records? How should histories of racial violence be commemorated? These are questions that have been taken up in many arenas of civic life, including public art, ""living history"" tourism, museum studies, and urban planning. They have also been taken up by theater artists and performance artists who use their bodies, narrative, historical fact and, sometimes, fiction to bear witness to the past and to imagine new futures. In this course, we will examine the role of theater and performance in constituting-and challenging-the historically contingent meanings of ""race;"" we will also explore how performance of history shapes national narratives.

As such, schools are an institution deserving of rigorous scrutiny and careful interrogation. But in studying K- 12 schools, we are in fact attending to a multitude of things - competing visions of and purposes for schools, and disparate experiences of accessing and navigating education that are widely divergent along axes of inequality. In this course, which will be conducted as a discussion-based seminar, we will engage with texts examining the enterprise of education from varied vantage points, but always through a sociological lens. We'll discuss the varied purposes theorists and practitioners envision for schools, and the extent to which schools live up to those ideals. We'll talk at length about how schools are a microcosm of many of the inequalities we see in the broader society, looking at issues of race, class, gender, and place. By taking a sociological lens to studying education, we'll learn a language and facility for rooting discussion of issues in education in theoretical grounding and empirical evidence. In so doing, students will develop the capacity to more critically assess scholarly research and public discourses on education, as well as their own experiences.

It is a system through which tens of millions of students pass each year; over the last few decades, the importance of earning a postsecondary credential has increased markedly. As such, higher education is deserving of rigorous scrutiny and careful interrogation. But in studying ""higher education,"" we are in fact attending to a multitude of things - among other things, varied institutional types with different resources and different imperatives, experiences of accessing and navigating higher education that are widely divergent along axes of inequality, and institutional processes that play out on campus but have resonance beyond the university gates. In this course, which will be conducted as a discussion-based seminar, we will engage with texts examining the enterprise of higher education from varied vantage points, but always through a sociological lens. We'll discuss why and how higher education came to be so important and loom so large in contemporary life, the stark differences between different sectors of the higher education landscape, and how stratification occurs between and within institutions. We'll talk at length about how higher education is a microcosm of many of the inequalities we see in the broader society, looking at issues of race, class, gender, and politics on campus.

We will study how forces -- such as de facto segregation, the disproportionate hyper-disciplining of students, punitive school climates, and the devaluing of certain forms of cultural and social capital -- can contribute to cycles of social reproduction among the marginalized. To address such challenges, this course introduces sociocultural theories and critical qualitative inquiry methods as mechanisms by which urban educational institutions can be positively transformed. Specifically, restorative practices, cogenerative dialogues, and participatory/co-researcher models are explored as methods that honor the voices of marginalized stakeholders and lead to catalytic, transformational impact.

This course considers politics across time, space, and individuals, noting how historical, geographical, cultural, social, psychological, political, and economic contexts can shape the politics of education. In addition, as this course considers the relationship between politics and power, we explore how politics can manifest itself in ways that promote exclusion and subjugation or work toward the common good.

Emphasis will be placed on the development of studio based visual art techniques across the K-12 curriculum and how these can be used to foster creativity, imagination, critical thinking skills, and individual solutions to a variety of visual and integration based problems. The philosophical bases for this course are the developing ideas that the arts are uniquely positioned to play an important role in helping all educators transform their teaching to address the needs of 21st century, K-12 learners. This progressive approach to arts education is based upon the framework that there are two separate but related roles for the arts in our schools. The first role for arts education is a standards based, sequential, comprehensive exploration of the arts founded on performance, criticism, process, communication and connections. The first role often takes a cross curricular approach to arts learning, but stays mainly focused on the arts. The second role is for the arts to be placed at the center of a variety of arts integration approaches to teaching and curriculum design.

It is a system through which tens of millions of students pass each year; over the last few decades, the importance of earning a postsecondary credential has increased markedly. As such, higher education is deserving of rigorous scrutiny and careful interrogation. But in studying ""higher education,"" we are in fact attending to a multitude of things - among other things, varied institutional types with different resources and different imperatives, experiences of accessing and navigating higher education that are widely divergent along axes of inequality, and institutional processes that play out on campus but have resonance beyond the university gates. In this course, which will be conducted as a discussion-based seminar, we will engage with texts examining the enterprise of higher education from varied vantage points, but always through a sociological lens. We'll discuss why and how higher education came to be so important and loom so large in contemporary life, the stark differences between different sectors of the higher education landscape, and how stratification occurs between and within institutions. We'll talk at length about how higher education is a microcosm of many of the inequalities we see in the broader society, looking at issues of race, class, gender, and politics on campus. By taking a sociological lens to studying higher education, we'll learn a language and facility for rooting discussion of issues in higher education in theoretical grounding and empirical evidence.

This course considers politics across time, space, and individuals, noting how historical, geographical, cultural, social, psychological, political, and economic contexts can shape the politics of education. In addition, as this course considers the relationship between politics and power, we explore how politics can manifest itself in ways that promote exclusion and subjugation or work toward the common good.

By engaging with substantive texts representing diverse perspectives, students will become more comfortable navigating scholarly research on teaching and learning in school settings, including distinguishing between multiple forms of scholarship (e.g. qualitative and quantitative studies, action research, self-study, portraiture, etc.) and other forms of writing about education (e.g. memoirs, advice based on personal experience, op-eds by thought leaders, etc.). Students will also theorize about reasons for gaps between educational research and practice by drawing on their knowledge of the sociocultural, political, and historical contexts of schooling. Ultimately, students will become more able to articulate their reasoned perspectives as emerging professionals regarding best practices for meaningful teaching and learning in school settings. Prerequisite: Completion of any 1000, 2000, or 3000-level Education course, graduate standing, or permission of instructor. Enrollment Note: All students are enrolled onto the waitlist.

782,L74 HBRW 4060,"Conflict or Convivencia? Muslims, Jews, and Christians in Medieval Spain",3.0 Units,"This seminar will explore various facets of the coexistence (convivencia) of Muslims, Jews, and Christians in medieval Spain. Its horizon stretches from the Muslim conquest of Iberia (al-Andalus) up to the turn of the 16th century when Spanish Jews and Muslims were equally faced with the choice between exile and conversion to Christianity. Until about 1100, Muslims dominated most of the Iberian Peninsula; from then onward, Christians ruled much and eventually all of what would become modern Spain and Portugal. Through a process known as reconquista (reconquest), Catholic kingdoms acquired large Muslim enclaves. As borders moved, Jewish communities found themselves under varying Muslim or Christian dominion. Interactions between the three religious communities occurred throughout, some characterized by shared creativity and mutual respect, others by rivalry and strife. The course focuses on these cultural encounters, placing them in various historical contexts. It will explore the ambiguities of religious conversion, and the interplay of persecution and toleration. Last not least, the course will address the question of how the memory of medieval Spain's diversity reverberates-and is utilized-in modern popular and academic discourse. All sources will be read in English translation; however, students are encouraged to make use of their linguistic and cultural expertise acquired in previous classes. This course serves as the capstone seminar for Jewish, Islamic & Near Eastern Studies majors, Arabic majors, and Hebrew majors.

(All primary texts are read in translation.) At the same time, we explore such overarching themes as: the interplay of esoteric exegesis of the Bible and visionary experiences; the place of traditional Jewish law (halakhah) within mystical thought and practice; the role of gender, sexuality, and the body in Jewish mystical speculation and prayer; the relationship between mysticism and messianism; Ashkenazic and Sephardic traditions and their mutual impact on Jewish mysticism; the ""absence of women"" from Jewish mystical movements; esoteric traditions of an elite vs. mysticism as a communal endeavor; and the tension between innovation and (the claim to) tradition in the history of Jewish mysticism.",HUM LCD ,HUM ,HUM ,H ,ETH IS ,01,-T-R---,11:30A-12:50P,TBA,Jacobs,Paper/Project/TakeHome,20,0,0

We will then examine many of the questions raised by feminist theory, feminist jurisprudence, and other critical perspectives. For example, is the legal subject gendered male, and, if so, how can advocates (for women and men) use the law to gain greater equality? What paradoxes have emerged in areas such as employment discrimination, family law, or reproductive rights, as women and others have sought liberal equality? What is the equality/difference debate about and why is it important for feminists? How do intersectionality and various schools of feminist thought affect our concepts of discrimination, equality, and justice? The course is thematic, but we will spend time on key cases that have influenced law and policy, examining how they affect the everyday lives of women.

From the nineteenth century to the present day, writers and filmmakers have revisited (and often subverted) questions that Dostoevsky's novel poses: What internal and external forces cause someone to ""step over"" into crime? What are the implications of a confession? To what extent can the legal system provide a just punishment? Are forgiveness and redemption possible, or even relevant? What role does grace--or luck--play in the entire process? This course begins with our close reading of Dostoevsky's novel and then moves on to short stories, novels, literary essays, and movies that engage in dialogue with the Russian predecessor. A central concern of our intertextual approach is to explore the interplay between specific socio-historical contexts and universal questions. All readings are in English.

Election law changes rapidly and is the subject of legal and political dispute in a number of areas that will affect the franchise during the 2008 elections. This course will examine federal constitutional and statutory law governing the right of suffrage and assess current controversies in these areas. While there is no specific ""right to vote"" explicitly stated in the U.S. Constitution, over time, it has been amended or interpreted to protect the right of franchise from being abridged based on race, gender, property ownership, age and other qualifications. Legislative enactments have also established rights with respect to voting. Each extension of voting rights has been a product of and resulted in social and political change. This course will examine the interplay of law and politics in the right to vote. The course will begin with the study of constitutional foundations, statutory protections and case law. We will then apply these principles to current issues in voting rights, including voter registration, voter identification, provisional ballots, voting machines, access for people with disabilities, felony disenfranchisement, voter suppression and voter fraud. Students will apply this knowledge to voting rights during the 2008 elections through hands-on involvement in voter education, monitoring or advocacy. The course will conclude with an assessment of the current issues in light of observations made by students during the 2008 elections, with an eye toward the advancement of election law and full enfranchisement in the future. The course involves the study of fundamental Supreme Court cases, interactive discussion of contemporary debates, and review of current litigation and legislative proposals.

Some contend that memory sites are ""the new lunch counters,"" where our racial politics are worked out. This course examines the racial politics of commemorative objects and practices, and commemorative intervention as a strategy of anti-racist activism. We begin with an historical survey of various ways that racism has been inscribed on the commemorative landscape, and readings in history, political theory, cultural studies, and other fields to gain insight on these contested commemorative objects, their development, and social significance. We then turn to a critical assessment of efforts to remove and recontextualize commemorative objects, and to erect new objects commemorating neglected figures and issues. We consider how these reparative efforts relate to what political theorists call remedies of recognition, and specifically how they might aid in advancing equal opportunity and justice. Through our study and engagement with contested commemorative landscapes, including local, national, and global cases, students will become familiar with the burgeoning interdisciplinary field of memory studies, diverse forms and sites of commemoration, local and global efforts to advance what has been termed ""commemorative justice,"" and challenges they face.",HUM SC ,HUM ,CPSC HUM ,H ,BA ,01,---R---,3:00P-5:50P,TBA,Ward,Paper/Project/TakeHome,15,0,0

What role do families and friends fill in this process? Students explore answers to these questions by reading theories and case studies that try to explain the foundations of individuals' sense of self and the interdependence and responsibilities of individuals, families, and communities to one another. Cases students read highlight (1) how family and communal experiences (like school) influence individuals and (2) how virtual (online) and non-virtual communities are structured and sustained as social entities. In addition to readings, the class will rely on guests from the ""real world"" as well as field trips into virtual and non-virtual communities.

846,L40 SOC 4310,Sociology of Higher Education,3.0 Units,"What we call ""higher education"" in the United States is a complex web of institutions - nearly 3,000 4-year colleges, 1,500 2-year colleges, and still more postsecondary institutions that grant a variety of credentials. It is a system through which tens of millions of students pass each year; over the last few decades, the importance of earning a postsecondary credential has increased markedly. As such, higher education is deserving of rigorous scrutiny and careful interrogation. But in studying ""higher education,"" we are in fact attending to a multitude of things - among other things, varied institutional types with different resources and different imperatives, experiences of accessing and navigating higher education that are widely divergent along axes of inequality, and institutional processes that play out on campus but have resonance beyond the university gates. In this course, which will be conducted as a discussion-based seminar, we will engage with texts examining the enterprise of higher education from varied vantage points, but always through a sociological lens. We'll discuss why and how higher education came to be so important and loom so large in contemporary life, the stark differences between different sectors of the higher education landscape, and how stratification occurs between and within institutions. We'll talk at length about how higher education is a microcosm of many of the inequalities we see in the broader society, looking at issues of race, class, gender, and politics on campus. By taking a sociological lens to studying higher education, we'll learn a language and facility for rooting discussion of issues in higher education in theoretical grounding and empirical evidence. In so doing, students will develop the capacity to more critically assess research and public discourses on higher education, as well as their own work and experiences in the sector. Prerequisite: Completion of any 1000, 2000, or 3000-level Education course, graduate standing, or permission of instructor.

847,L40 SOC 4621,Politics of Education,3.0 Units,"In this course, politics is interpreted broadly to include both formal policy-making processes and any situation in which people have to solve a problem or come to a decision. The purpose of this course is to explore the following processes: (1) how ideologies and power dynamics influence educational policies and decisions; (2) how educational policies and decisions translate into specific school programs and practices; (3) how specific programs and practices influence pedagogies, especially in the relationships among students, teachers, and knowledge pedagogies; (4) how these pedagogies impact student opportunities and outcomes; and (5) how student outcomes and opportunities reinforce ideologies and power dynamics. This course considers politics across time, space, and individuals, noting how historical, geographical, cultural, social, psychological, political, and economic contexts can shape the politics of education. In addition, as this course considers the relationship between politics and power, we explore how politics can manifest itself in ways that promote exclusion and subjugation or work toward the common good. Finally, after carefully examining the research on inequalities and inefficiencies resulting from the current politics of education, we will transition from problem identification (i.e., ""What went wrong?"") to problem solution (i.e., ""Where do we go from here?"").

Of course, individuals reproduce, but when, how, why, and with whom we do (or do not) is also a matter of public policy and social concern. Drawing on readings from sociology, law and other fields we engage continually with these key questions: Why is reproduction an important site through which to understand sociology? How do statuses such as race, class, gender, sexuality, and ability influence people's reproductive possibilities? How have communities supported or resisted efforts at reproductive control? Why is reproductive justice central to these answers? We review theoretical pieces, empirical research, media and more to explore the answers. This course primarily focuses on the US but will expose students to global reproductive concerns. Class sessions include lecture, in-class discussion and online discussion, media analysis and other activities. This upper-level seminar presumes an understanding of the basic concepts in sociology such as sociological imagination and social construction.

As such, schools are an institution deserving of rigorous scrutiny and careful interrogation. But in studying K- 12 schools, we are in fact attending to a multitude of things - competing visions of and purposes for schools, and disparate experiences of accessing and navigating education that are widely divergent along axes of inequality. In this course, which will be conducted as a discussion-based seminar, we will engage with texts examining the enterprise of education from varied vantage points, but always through a sociological lens.

893,L40 SOC 5311,Sociology of Higher Education,3.0 Units,"What we call ""higher education"" in the United States is a complex web of institutions - nearly 3,000 4-year colleges, 1,500 2-year colleges, and still more postsecondary institutions that grant a variety of credentials. It is a system through which tens of millions of students pass each year; over the last few decades, the importance of earning a postsecondary credential has increased markedly. As such, higher education is deserving of rigorous scrutiny and careful interrogation. But in studying ""higher education,"" we are in fact attending to a multitude of things - among other things, varied institutional types with different resources and different imperatives, experiences of accessing and navigating higher education that are widely divergent along axes of inequality, and institutional processes that play out on campus but have resonance beyond the university gates. In this course, which will be conducted as a discussion-based seminar, we will engage with texts examining the enterprise of higher education from varied vantage points, but always through a sociological lens. We'll discuss why and how higher education came to be so important and loom so large in contemporary life, the stark differences between different sectors of the higher education landscape, and how stratification occurs between and within institutions. We'll talk at length about how higher education is a microcosm of many of the inequalities we see in the broader society, looking at issues of race, class, gender, and politics on campus. By taking a sociological lens to studying higher education, we'll learn a language and facility for rooting discussion of issues in higher education in theoretical grounding and empirical evidence. In so doing, students will develop the capacity to more critically assess research and public discourses on higher education, as well as their own work and experiences in the sector. Prerequisite: Completion of any 1000, 2000, or 3000-level Education course, graduate standing, or permission of instructor.

Drawing on readings from sociology, law and other fields we engage continually with these key questions: Why is reproduction an important site through which to understand sociology? How do statuses such as race, class, gender, sexuality, and ability influence people's reproductive possibilities? How have communities supported or resisted efforts at reproductive control? Why is reproductive justice central to these answers? We review theoretical pieces, empirical research, media and more to explore the answers. This course primarily focuses on the US but will expose students to global reproductive concerns.

While diet fads come and go, it seems this new enthusiasm for ""Paleo diets"" is here to stay. But what is a ""Paleo diet"" anyway? Through a comparative evolutionary and anthropological approach we will examine the diets of extinct hominins, our extant primate relatives, ethnohistoric and contemporary foraging peoples, and even our own dietary habits. We will strive to answer key questions about diets in prehistory and their implications for living people today: How do we know what our ancestors ate? How have dietary hypotheses been used to explain processes in human evolution? How bad is agriculture for global health? What role did certain foods play in shaping our modern physiology? Are we maladapted to our contemporary diets? What does it mean to eat ""Paleo""?

In this course, we will study Indigenous presence in St. Louis and how Indigenous geographies overlap and coexist in tension with settler-colonial geographies. While St. Louis began as a French colonial settlement, established by fur traders in 1764, the lands that the city occupied were and continue to be Native lands. What we call St. Louis was a geography shared by many Indigenous peoples. The region was a major urban center between the 11th and 14th centuries-today referred to as Cahokia. It then became a territory shared by many tribes, including Ni Okaska (Osage), Niúachi (Missouria), Illiniwek (Illinois Confederacy), and others. In the nineteenth century, some of these tribes were coerced into leaving their homelands and sent to reservations in Indian Territory (also known as Oklahoma). A century later, St. Louis was one of the urban centers where Indigenous people were relocated as part of an effort to break up tribes and the reservation system. And today Indigenous peoples from all over the continent inhabit St. Louis as a place of family, friendships, community, of livelihoods, education, and creative practices; but also, as a place of contestation, as a city structured by systems of domination, such as race and class, and Indigenous erasure. Loosely following this historical timeline, we will study how this erasure happened and engage with different sources to study St. Louis as an ongoing Indigenous place and space.",HUM SD ,HUM ,CPSC HUM ,H ,BA ,01,M-W----,1:00P-2:20P,TBA,Gill,Paper/Project/TakeHome,19,0,0

Can architects manufacture consent for political repression or engage in activism? What happens when designed systems fail? Design is everywhere. It is in the water you drink; it is in the built material and digital spaces you hang out in; and it is in the chair you are sitting in. And yet, perhaps because of its ubiquity, design receives very little attention from scholars in the humanities and even less from African studies. In this course, we will examine a number of case studies, from minor architectures and ruins in Monrovia to hydraulic engineering in Johannesburg and iconic architecture in Casablanca to DIY market spaces in Nairobi and insurgent public space-making in Kinshasa. We will explore the ways that designers, architects, and technocrats engineer authority and how (sometimes) urban residents take it apart. One potential definition (among many other potential definitions) of design could be the following: the practices that humans employ to arrange, engineer, plan and fashion their material, digital, and social environments. But designs are also artifacts -- master plans, prototypes, and brands -- that occupy social lives independent of their assigned functions. Design is often about aspirations for a better world and finding technological and aesthetic solutions to social problems. Yet the products of design -- from zoning codes and service delivery networks to iconic built structures -- seem to always invite failures, disruptions, hackings, and ruination. A central argument in this course is that understanding design is also key to understanding power, inequality, and insurgency in Africa.

Humanity has been defined on the basis of its uniquely well-developed capacities for using technology, language, and culturally encoded knowledge and belief systems. In this course, we will explore a new hypothesis of human exceptionalism: a fundamental tendency to cultivate and care for lands. Our genius for reshaping ecosystems and incorporating other species into our societies is intimately linked to our technological and communicative skills. We have used these skills to migrate into and reshape every Earthly environment. We will explore the ethnographies, oral and written histories, and archaeologies, of so-called hunter-gatherers around the world, learning about the ways they shaped and tended their homelands using ecological knowledge systems. In this era of human induced environmental change - from global warming, to mass extinction, to genetic engineering - it is critically important that we look to our species' true ecological history for the wisdom that will help us meet these challenges.",SSC ,SSC ,SSC ,S ,BA ETH IS ,01,M-W----,1:00P-2:20P,TBA,Mueller,Paper/Project/TakeHome,20,0,0

Fuji) to the construction of planned urban settings where culture is writ large in overt and subtle contexts. Over the past two decades or so, anthropologists, archaeologists, and geographers have developed a wide body of research concerning these socially constructed and perceived settings -- commonly known as ""landscapes"". This course takes a tour through time and across the globe to trace the formation of diverse social landscapes, starting in prehistoric times and ending in modern times. We will cover various urban landscapes, rural landscapes, nomadic landscapes (and others) and the intersection of the natural environment, the built environments, and the symbolism that weaves them together. Chronologically, we will range from 3000 BCE to 2009 CE and we will cover all the continents. This course will also trace the intellectual history of the study of landscape as a social phenomenon, and will investigate the current methods used to recover and describe social landscapes around the world and through time.

In grappling with these questions, students will directly engage with the texts through close reading and in-class discussion. Students will, at the same time, also ask broader questions that concern how knowledge is produced, spread, and consumed: what is a canon? Who are the gatekeepers? What does it mean to approach East Asia through a set of ""canonical"" texts? Among the texts considered will be The Analects, Daodejing, Lotus Sutra, Tale of Genji, Tales of the Heike, Tales of Moonlight and Rain, Samguk yusa, and Memoirs of Lady Hyegyong.

Why have so many novels and films memorialized adolescence? How has the period of development been portrayed in recent American fiction? How have depictions and attitudes toward teen culture changed over the past fifty years? We will begin with J.D. Salinger's classic novel of adolescence alienation, ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" a book that in many ways helped initiate the rise of the youth movement in the 1950s and 60s. From there, we will read a series of novels and historical studies that will trace the changes in teen culture that have occurred over the past half century. Our class will also consider a few films, such as ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""Dazed and Confused,"" which have helped shape our conception of the American teenager.

An inexhaustible public witness and the author of poems, plays, essays, novels, and short stories, the Harlem-born Baldwin ranks with the most daring and elegant American literary voices. His first novel, the autobiographical ""Go Tell It on the Mountain"" (1953), wrestled with the dual heritage of Black Christianity and Depression-era Black social realism. His second novel, ""Giovanni's Room"" (1956), set in Paris and peopled with non-black characters, explored the intricacies of same-sex desire years before the Stonewall rebellion announced the gay rights movement. ""Notes of a Native Son"" (1955), the first collection of Baldwin's lush and searching essays and a grandparent of twenty-first century autocriticism, is perhaps the most-tweeted book of our era. Our reading list will contain all of these books, but we'll end with a sequence of texts revealing various facets of Baldwin's resurrected meaning in the wake of Black Lives Matter: among them, Ta-Nehisi Coates's memoir ""Between the World and Me"" (2015); Raoul Peck's documentary ""I Am Not Your Negro"" (2017); and Eddie Glaude Jr.'s Trump-era treatise ""Begin Again"" (2020).

Buck was the first American woman to win the Award and the third American overall (playwright Eugene O'Neill won it in 1936). Both were not only highly esteemed writers; Lewis a satirist of American classes and cultural manners, and Buck largely known for her realistic works about Asia (she grew up in China), the theme of the pull of tradition against rebellion, and her biographies of her missionary parents. Both were popular as well: Lewis's novels Babbitt, Arrowsmith, Elmer Gantry, Mantrap, Dodsworth, Ann Vickers, and Cass Timberlane were made into films. Buck's novels The Good Earth, Dragon Seed, China Sky, and Pavilion of Women were made into films as well as her script for what turned out to be Leo McCarey's last film, Satan Never Sleeps. Except for Lewis's dystopian novel about a fascist takeover of the United States, It Can Happen Here, the works of neither author are as read as they were at the authors' height of fame. This course is an exploration of some the major and lesser-known works of Lewis and Buck, and a consideration of their status in American letters. Why did their best works make the impact they did? And how did their work affect the direction of American literature, particularly from the 1920s through the 1940s?",HUM ,HUM ,HUM ,H ,,01,M-W----,8:30A-9:50A,TBA,Early,Paper/Project/TakeHome,15,0,0

In this course we will learn why English contains words like ""won't,"" ""its,"" and ""whom,"" and how it happened that spelling and pronunciation parted ways. We will look at how the Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Viking, and Norman invasions of Britain influenced the development of the language.

Rather than aiming to provide a comprehensive survey of the multifaceted discipline via coverage of literary periods or literary theory, this course invites us to grapple with the core questions and prominent debates surrounding its methods and objectives. Foregrounding the dis-orienting effects of the literary, the course begins by examining the history of the discipline and its institutions, including shifting definitions of our objects of study; the histories of exclusion and inclusion that accompany these shifts; and, issues of canonicity, especially as they relate to empire building both within and outside the academy. Then, we will explore the methods of literary critique, thinking about what is at stake in the objects we study and the ways we choose to read them. Finally, we will engage with challenges to the traditional organizing principles of our field, including its geographies, periodization, and archives. In elucidating the multiple contexts and histories that condition our position within the university in the present moment, this course aspires to nuance the values and effects of pursuing an English Ph.D. for doing work both in and beyond academia.",,,,,,01,M------,4:00P-6:50P,TBA,Micir,No final,8,0,0

We will use Jodie Archer and Matthew Jockers' The Bestseller Code: Anatomy of the Blockbuster Novel as our guide through this topic. We will close-read novels that both adhere to and depart from trends among bestsellers (including Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson).

1083,L14 E Lit 5111,Topics in American Literature: James Baldwin Now,3.0 Units,"Marking the centennial of his birth in 1924, this class will examine why James Baldwin became the twentieth-century African American author most loved in the twenty-first. An inexhaustible public witness and the author of poems, plays, essays, novels, and short stories, the Harlem-born Baldwin ranks with the most daring and elegant American literary voices. His first novel, the autobiographical ""Go Tell It on the Mountain"" (1953), wrestled with the dual heritage of Black Christianity and Depression-era Black social realism. His second novel, ""Giovanni's Room"" (1956), set in Paris and peopled with non-black characters, explored the intricacies of same-sex desire years before the Stonewall rebellion announced the gay rights movement. ""Notes of a Native Son"" (1955), the first collection of Baldwin's lush and searching essays and a grandparent of twenty-first century autocriticism, is perhaps the most-tweeted book of our era. Our reading list will contain all of these books, but we'll end with a sequence of texts revealing various facets of Baldwin's resurrected meaning in the wake of Black Lives Matter: among them, Ta-Nehisi Coates's memoir ""Between the World and Me"" (2015); Raoul Peck's documentary ""I Am Not Your Negro"" (2017); and Eddie Glaude Jr.'s Trump-era treatise ""Begin Again"" (2020). Altogether, this will be a single-author course on a singular author whose life after death illuminates crucial issues in Black cultural politics in two centuries. Satisfies the Twentieth Century and later requirement.

1086,L14 E Lit 5651,Seminar: Romanticism and Modernism,3.0 Units,"Romanticism and Modernism are the two isms spanning the long turns of their respective centuries: 1789-1830 and 1880-1920. These periods may look like matching halves of a long history, but any understanding of the connectedness of the two historical periods is largely unformed and still unwritten in the literary and cultural criticism of both eras. The truth of that connective story motivates the narrative of this course. A totality of cultural history comes not through literature alone but in its conjunction with the arts of music and painting and a historically informed understanding of the politics. A special focus on the poetry in the literature and a prioritizing of revolution in political history will locate the main points of overlap and, in the end, offer the coordinates of an understanding of relationship and difference across the two periods and, more than that interconnectedness, the beginnings of a history altogether different to the existing ones. Call-and-answer is a rough formatting for the dialogue we wish to begin as we listen to the cultural texts of these two spots of crisis time, the two isms of their consecutive centuries echoing ahead and answering back. From the French Revolution through the Napoleonic Wars; from the later 19th century through the Great War into Revolutions not only in Russia after the 1914 war but also inside that war: these are the circumstantial parallels that establish the ground for comparative analysis in the historical force fields these two periods join in forming. Our topical locations include Feminism, Race and Empire, Poetry and the People, Poetry and Revolution, Experimental Poetics, the Gesamtkuntswerk or Total Work of Art as a utopian project and dystopian event, and the historicity of classical, romantic, modernist, and popular music. Our artists include Coleridge, Mina Loy, Mary Wollstonecraft, Gertrude Stein, Wordsworth, Pound, Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley, Wyndham Lewis and William Blake, Richard Wagner and Frederick Chopin, Beethoven and Stravinsky and Shostakovich, James Weldon Johnson and Aimé Césaire and Claude McKay, Delacroix and Turner and Goya, Marinetti and other avant-garde writers and painters, Picasso, and many more.

In order to understand both classical astronomy and the results obtained from modern telescopes and the space program, basic scientific ideas are reviewed first. There will also some discussion of astronomical history to show how we have arrived at our present ideas of the structure and evolution of the solar system. Although the course addresses primarily non-science majors, also science majors can use it as a general introduction to modern astrophysics. There will be no final exam.

1189,L31 Physics 312,Introduction to Astrophysics,3.0 Units,"Astrophysics is the study of the planets, the Sun and other stars, the Milky Way Galaxy and the other galaxies, the interstellar medium and intergalactic medium, and the Universe itself. This study is aided by our knowledge of the laws of Physics discovered by experiments carried out in laboratories. Occasionally the astronomical observations reveal new fundamental laws of Physics. For example the observations of motions of the planets helped Newton discover the universe square law of gravitation. We begin with the motions of the Sun and the Moon as we see them across the sky, then to the motions of the planets. We then go on to describe how stars are born, and evolve, until they end up as white dwarfs, neutron stars or black holes. During this evolution, elements like C, N, O, etc. all the way to U were synthesized and dispersed across the Galaxy by stellar winds and supernova explosions. We will also discuss fascinating topics, like, cosmic rays and astronomies with radio, x-ray, gamma-ray and gravitational waves. In short we will discuss everything that is contained in the universe and the evolution of the universe itself. The purpose of the course is to kindle your interest in these exotic phenomena and prepare you for their more detailed study. Knowledge of the Physics described in the introductory course in physics (such as 197 and 198) will be very helpful in readily following the lectures; however a brief summary of the needed background will be provided during the lectures.

While the founding of the city of Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia, dates back to the Roman empire (i.e., the first century BCE), the city of Madrid, the capital of Spain, was established during the 15th century around a small fortification developed during Al-Andalus, soon becoming the political center of the Spanish Empire during the 16th century. Through an examination of the urban development of both cities across time and the various contemporary urban spaces and cultures of the 21st century, this course will explore the ways in which writers (Jorge Carrion, Belen Gopegui, Julio Llamazares), musicians (Joan Manuel Serrat, Rosalia), visual artists (Pablo Picasso, Cristina Garcia Rodero, Angeles Santos Torroella), filmmakers (Jose Luis Guerin, Isabel Coixet, Chus Gutierrez) and architects (Juan de Villanueva, Antoni Gaudi) have reflected on and explored through their work in both cities. We will also explore the political and social relevance of both cities today as related to their own urban planning and development as well as their political relevance in both Catalonia and Spain as a whole. This course will have a strong, mandatory and graded written communications component, and it is taught in Spanish. It also fulfills the Writing Intensive (WI) requirement for Arts & Sciences students. Prerequisites: Span 303 or Span 308D, and one (or preferably two) of the following: Span 341, Span 342, Span 343, Span 370, Span 380, or Debating Cultures.

Using a combination of literary texts, artwork, testimonials, films, and scholarly articles, we will look at food, both as material commodity and metaphor, through the lens of Hispanic America's colonial and postcolonial past. Some topics include ethnic and gender identities, the history of enslavement and plantation economy (sugar, coffee), African-descendant and Indigenous spirituality as it pertains to food rituals, interplay of migration and exile in culinary transformations, along with multiple perspectives on everyday life (hunger, diets and dieting, food rationing, etc.). Due to the interdisciplinary perspectives inherent to this course, students will have an opportunity to engage their knowledge of and interest in disciplines outside the humanities (including but not limited to: sociology, psychology, public health, anthropology, global studies) in the exploration of food/gastronomy/culinary cultures, past, present, and future.

We will focus on curatorial discourse as a unique form of communication, a genre in itself that is often understated on the role it plays in shaping, shifting, and contesting cultural and social identities. We will analyze how curatorial language inhabits not only writing but visual culture, speech, heritage collections, gallery installations, and even architecture, fashion, and food. We will discuss how the instability of curatorial discourse reveals the instability and contradictions within cultural heritage itself, deceivingly presented constantly as a neutral, unchangeable, and unquestionable entity. The materials and reflections in this course will ponder on cultural heritage as inevitably curated, discern the forms and implications of such mediation, and study curatorial practice and the trade of the curator as a form of agency that should aim to be ethical, inclusive, collaborative, and always challenged and renewed. We will work with a wide variety of materials from the early 20th century to contemporary Mexico that range from gallery and museum texts to political speeches, mass-media dispatches, literary texts, scholarly research, critical essays, interviews, fiction, magazine articles, manifestos, fashion statements, food menus, and architecture. These will lead us to reflect on how curatorial practice is a dynamic tool for understanding, renewing, preserving, and sometimes defying cultural heritage and what it stands for at different times and for different people. *This course has a substantial, mandatory and graded written communications component and is taught in Spanish.

In addition, a plethora of ""magical"" papyri illustrate medical and religious practices; personal letters reveal the lives of everyday people; and troves of business documents (e.g., contracts, wills, governmental petitions, receipts) have proved important for understanding Roman and Byzantine economies. Because Roman Egypt was a highly bilingual society, there are even instances of Classical Greek literature translated into Coptic (e.g., selections of Homer and Plato), and these offer a unique witness to how such texts were received by Egyptians.

The paradoxical pursuit of infinite growth on a finite planet has real-world consequences: from climate change to increasing income inequality to stagnant and declining quality of life for most of us to the ongoing mass extinction of species not deemed economically useful to us, but whose loss simplifies ecosystems to the point of collapse. If these trends continue, we will face very difficult times ecologically and socio-politically. One alternative to infinite-planet economic theory is Ecological Economics, which can be described as economics as if the laws of thermodynamics are true and apply to us. Alone among disciplines with aspiration to analytic rigor, the field of economics has remained unaffected by the thermodynamic revolution that transformed the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, even history in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This failure to take physical law into account is one great source of our society's environmental (and social, and political) problems. Ecological economics thus represents the continuation of the thermodynamic revolution begun in the 1880s. This course is designed to give you an appropriate grounding in the fundamental assumptions, the conceptual novelties, and the distinctive tools of analysis that comprise this emergent school of economic theory, while placing this theorizing in historical and ecological context. We'll pay particular attention to how the precepts and practice of Ecological Economics illuminate the largest challenge facing humans today, the necessity of developing an ecologically sustainable society, one that is sized to the limits of our finite planet.",SSC ,SSC ,SSC ,S ,BA ,01,M-W----,2:30P-3:50P,Schnuck Pav / 202   ,VanRiper,No final,15,0,0

However, the absence of acknowledging human progress reinforces social fear and a sense of danger. The resulting panic leads to a preferencing of solutions which appear ""in harmony with nature,"" limiting our understanding and trust of viable alternative solutions using our best social, economic and technological powers.

This socialization comes in many forms, including the generation of sacred natural places (e.g., Mt. Fuji) to the construction of planned urban settings where culture is writ large in overt and subtle contexts. Over the past two decades or so, anthropologists, archaeologists, and geographers have developed a wide body of research concerning these socially constructed and perceived settings -- commonly known as ""landscapes"". This course takes a tour through time and across the globe to trace the formation of diverse social landscapes, starting in prehistoric times and ending in modern times. We will cover various urban landscapes, rural landscapes, nomadic landscapes (and others) and the intersection of the natural environment, the built environments, and the symbolism that weaves them together. Chronologically, we will range from 3000 BCE to 2009 CE and we will cover all the continents. This course will also trace the intellectual history of the study of landscape as a social phenomenon, and will investigate the current methods used to recover and describe social landscapes around the world and through time.

The final product of the course will be a literature review and tractable research question about a topic of your choice. One of the most important pieces of conducting research is to generate an interesting and important research question that is grounded in what we already know, contextualized by previous research, and justified by what gaps yet remain in our knowledge. Researchers craft and share this motivation in a literature review, contextualizes, justifies, and motivates the research question. Drafting a literature review is a critical and large part of the process, because working through writing of ideas is often how the ideas are shaped and refined, in large part because writing is thinking. In class we will cover a variety of concepts and skills that are useful in any discipline in terms of searching for the right kind of background information and data, evaluating types and quality of sources, reading and summarizing literature, constructing a logical and persuasive written argument, reference management, and data management and visualization. This course serves all students in the interdisciplinary environmental space, because the content and skills of this course apply to the literature review process across the range of humanities, social science, and natural science disciplines. We will touch on disciplinary conventions where they differ, but most of the content and skills are common and apply to all disciplines. Some students will go on to pursue a senior thesis research project while others may not, but all students will be able to transfer the skills you learn here into other course and capstone work, professional school and professional work going forward. Through reading, individual homework activities, and group discussion and class activities, you will learn and practice skills. Over the course of the semester, you will complete phased assignments that build up to a written literature review on a topic of your choice.

1383,L22 History 2052,Historical Fiction & Fictional Histories,3.0 Units,"The relationship between history and fiction has always been contentious and sometimes turbulent, not least because the two genres have traditionally been seen as mutually exclusive. However, new hybrid forms of writing-from historical fiction, to docudramas, to fictionalized biographies-have led to the blurring of the boundary and encouraged the claim that history itself is just another form of fiction. At the same time, historical novelists have placed increasing emphasis on the authenticity, sometimes even the accuracy, of their narratives and characterizations. And further still, contemporary writers are challenging dominant historical narratives by creating plausible fictions from the perspectives of the subordinated, the marginalized and the disenfranchised: plebeians, women, and indigenous, enslaved, and diasporic peoples. As historical novels become ever more popular, the distinction between history and fiction appears to be collapsing before our eyes. Through reading and discussing some outstanding examples of the genre of historical fiction published between the early nineteenth and the early twenty-first century (from Walter Scott to Charles Dickens, from Toni Morrison to Amitav Ghosh, from Graham Swift to Hilary Mantel), this course will investigate whether history is 'factual' or just another form of fiction; whether the appeal of historical fiction should lie in its authenticity; whether the recent success of historical novels should be viewed as a new development, or rather, as a revival of an older literary tradition; and whether novelists and dramatists are more adept than historians at interrogating issues of memory, identity, and change.",HUM ,,,H ,,01,-T-R---,4:00P-5:20P,TBA,Hindle,Paper/Project/TakeHome,30,0,0

While St. Louis began as a French colonial settlement, established by fur traders in 1764, the lands that the city occupied were and continue to be Native lands. What we call St. Louis was a geography shared by many Indigenous peoples. The region was a major urban center between the 11th and 14th centuries-today referred to as Cahokia. It then became a territory shared by many tribes, including Ni Okaska (Osage), Niúachi (Missouria), Illiniwek (Illinois Confederacy), and others. In the nineteenth century, some of these tribes were coerced into leaving their homelands and sent to reservations in Indian Territory (also known as Oklahoma). A century later, St. Louis was one of the urban centers where Indigenous people were relocated as part of an effort to break up tribes and the reservation system. And today Indigenous peoples from all over the continent inhabit St. Louis as a place of family, friendships, community, of livelihoods, education, and creative practices; but also, as a place of contestation, as a city structured by systems of domination, such as race and class, and Indigenous erasure.

Muslims, Jews, and Christians in Medieval Spain",3.0 Units,"This seminar will explore various facets of the coexistence (convivencia) of Muslims, Jews, and Christians in medieval Spain. Its horizon stretches from the Muslim conquest of Iberia (al-Andalus) up to the turn of the 16th century when Spanish Jews and Muslims were equally faced with the choice between exile and conversion to Christianity. Until about 1100, Muslims dominated most of the Iberian Peninsula; from then onward, Christians ruled much and eventually all of what would become modern Spain and Portugal. Through a process known as reconquista (reconquest), Catholic kingdoms acquired large Muslim enclaves. As borders moved, Jewish communities found themselves under varying Muslim or Christian dominion. Interactions between the three religious communities occurred throughout, some characterized by shared creativity and mutual respect, others by rivalry and strife. The course focuses on these cultural encounters, placing them in various historical contexts. It will explore the ambiguities of religious conversion, and the interplay of persecution and toleration. Last not least, the course will address the question of how the memory of medieval Spain's diversity reverberates-and is utilized-in modern popular and academic discourse. All sources will be read in English translation; however, students are encouraged to make use of their linguistic and cultural expertise acquired in previous classes.

It experienced four major social revolutions and gave rise to many consequential guerrilla movements. This course uses theories of revolution and a social science historical approach to elucidate the causes, processes, outcomes, and implications of revolutions in Mexico (1910), Bolivia (1952), Cuba (1959), and Nicaragua (1979). It also analyzes late 20th century revolutionary guerrilla movements in El Salvador and Peru.

The course explores New York City's ambivalent relationship with America, with the world, and with itself. It focuses on matters of power - how, in different moments of the city's history, it was defined, who held it, and how various groups managed to contest for it; matters of exchange and extraction - political, cultural, and economic; and matters of belonging - whether a city of immigrants, exiles and refugees succeeded in becoming a home for the homeless. It pays close attention to both the micro - the street corner and the political ward; the bridge and the tunnel; the gentrifying neighborhood; the mosaic of the city's foodways; the theater, financial, slaughterhouse, brothel, and other districts - and the macro - the banks and the stock exchange; the port and transit authorities; the instrumentalities of knowledge and cultural production in the city's universities, print media, clubs, and salons; the sports empires; and the political machines, organized crime, grassroots labor and political movements, insurgencies, and undergrounds. Above all, the course will foreground the city's massive and unbearable contradictions, as a city of skyscrapers and of basement dives, lures, and snares; as a symbol of the future and freedom bound to traumatic, slave, and unfree pasts; as a symbol of modern independence bound to modern interdependence; and as a place of renaissances and ruinations, where the world either comes together or spectacularly falls apart. Sites of potential investigation, in a list that is suggestive rather than exhaustive, range from the African Burial Ground to the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, from Hamilton to Hamilton, from Boss Tweed to Robert Moses, from the Five Points to Chinatown, from Delmonico's to Sylvia's, from Blackwell's Island Lunatic Asylum to Hart Island Potter's Field, from the African Free School to Ocean Hill-Brownsville, from Marcus Garvey to Amadou Diallo, from Billie Holiday to Andy Warhol, from James Baldwin's Harlem to Stonewall, from George Steinbrenner to Jerry Seinfeld, from the Gowanus Canal to Estée Lauder, and, in the spirit of the course title, from Stuyvesant to Trump. Students will engage with the history of New York City via two three-page book reviews, a three-page site analysis, and two five-minute oral reports on assigned readings before conducting their own original research in consultation with the instructor that will culminate in a 15-page final essay. Attendance at all classes and participation in class discussions required. This course fulfills the history major capstone requirement as an Advanced Seminar.

Global Asias seeks to open up avenues of inquiry to accommodate the study of flows of people, ideas, and practices across Asia and throughout the world. It provides the opportunity to consider Asian communities as they manifest themselves in different places and different ways. We begin with a survey of past attempts to define, understand, and manage Asia, which resulted in an area studies approach.

The cultural, social, and political lives of Jews have undergone major transformations and dislocations over this time-from innovation to revolution, exclusion to integration, calamity to triumphs. The themes that we will be exploring in depth include the campaigns for and against Jewish ""emancipation;"" acculturation and religious reform; traditionalism and modernism in Eastern Europe; the rise of political and racial antisemitism; mass migration and the formation of American Jewry; varieties of Jewish national politics; Jewish-Gentile relations between the World Wars; the destruction of European Jewry; the emergence of a Jewish nation-state; and Jewish culture and identity since 1945.",HUM LCD SC SD ,,HUM ,H ,HUM IS ,01,M-W----,4:00P-5:20P,TBA,Jay,Paper/Project/TakeHome,20,0,0

Campaigns are start-ups that rely on strategy, branding, influencing consumers (voters), financing and other concepts to achieve the election of their candidate. At the same time, American politics is highly polarized, with voters who are increasingly hostile to listening to the other side. Given this context, how does a campaign succeed as an entrepreneurial venture? This course will allow students to compare and contrast how different candidates' policies and platforms may affect different constituencies/sectors of the business/labor world as well as the economy, how the media portrays them, and what role they will play in the general election.

What drives people to migrate from their home communities? What challenges do they face along migration routes? As humans move, languages, ideas, and ways of life diffuse across territories. This diffusion can be integrated into host societies, or it can become a source of tension within the society. What political, social, and economic conditions facilitate this integration or tension? In this course, we will begin to answer these questions through the lens of U.S. migration policies.

Election law changes rapidly and is the subject of legal and political dispute in a number of areas that will affect the franchise during the 2008 elections. This course will examine federal constitutional and statutory law governing the right of suffrage and assess current controversies in these areas. While there is no specific ""right to vote"" explicitly stated in the U.S. Constitution, over time, it has been amended or interpreted to protect the right of franchise from being abridged based on race, gender, property ownership, age and other qualifications. Legislative enactments have also established rights with respect to voting. Each extension of voting rights has been a product of and resulted in social and political change. This course will examine the interplay of law and politics in the right to vote. The course will begin with the study of constitutional foundations, statutory protections and case law. We will then apply these principles to current issues in voting rights, including voter registration, voter identification, provisional ballots, voting machines, access for people with disabilities, felony disenfranchisement, voter suppression and voter fraud. Students will apply this knowledge to voting rights during the 2008 elections through hands-on involvement in voter education, monitoring or advocacy. The course will conclude with an assessment of the current issues in light of observations made by students during the 2008 elections, with an eye toward the advancement of election law and full enfranchisement in the future.

We shall consider several issues lying at the intersection of social and political psychology. We begin with consideration of what it means to be ""liberal"" or ""conservative"", and the complexities inherent in measuring ideology and its relation to voting. We then consider dynamics of political polarization: what factors drive liberals and conservatives to disagree with one another, and is there any way of reducing these divisions?

The class has four parts. We begin the course by weighing the concept of identity and different forms and venues in which it shapes political engagement. We follow this segment with a look at the mobilization of ultra-nationalist politics in domestic and international settings in order to understand the different social and political threads associated with nationalist identities. We then turn to exploring the more widely cited theories that explain the mechanics of political mobilization and movements. Finally, we look at a series of politically engaged groups that have strong identity elements in order to assess their similarities and differences domestically and internationally across the 21st century. This latter stage entails substantial group work to build the cases.

Muslims, Jews, and Christians in Medieval Spain",3.0 Units,"This seminar will explore various facets of the coexistence (convivencia) of Muslims, Jews, and Christians in medieval Spain. Its horizon stretches from the Muslim conquest of Iberia (al-Andalus) up to the turn of the 16th century when Spanish Jews and Muslims were equally faced with the choice between exile and conversion to Christianity. Until about 1100, Muslims dominated most of the Iberian Peninsula; from then onward, Christians ruled much and eventually all of what would become modern Spain and Portugal. Through a process known as reconquista (reconquest), Catholic kingdoms acquired large Muslim enclaves. As borders moved, Jewish communities found themselves under varying Muslim or Christian dominion. Interactions between the three religious communities occurred throughout, some characterized by shared creativity and mutual respect, others by rivalry and strife. The course focuses on these cultural encounters, placing them in various historical contexts. It will explore the ambiguities of religious conversion, and the interplay of persecution and toleration. Last not least, the course will address the question of how the memory of medieval Spain's diversity reverberates-and is utilized-in modern popular and academic discourse. All sources will be read in English translation; however, students are encouraged to make use of their linguistic and cultural expertise acquired in previous classes.

Together, we will find out what happens when you fuse creative impulse with rigorous research and let it loose on the airwaves.

1724,L59 CWP 207,The Scholar and Social Change: Writing between Research and Political Urgency,3.0 Units,"While scholarship has a fraught relationship with timely action, some scholars understand and position their intellectual activities as promoting real-world change to bring about a more equitable and just future. By better understanding a seemingly intractable problem, we should be better able to empower others with actionable knowledge. And by better reflecting on the socio-political role of scholarship, we should be able to bridge the gap between knowledge and action. To that end, this course is devoted to scholarship that reflects on the state and the university as institutions beset by powerful interests working against the people's interests and the pursuit of knowledge. In mainly seminar-style class discussion, we will connect urgent affairs of the day to academic literature on institutional racism, settler colonialism, capitalism, and the coalitions that resist them. Readings will include works by canonical and contemporary scholars who reflect on political action, the university, and the state. Research will include Supreme Court cases, government reports, United Nations resolutions, and national, local and campus newspapers. Case studies are drawn from anti-pipeline protest, liberation movements, divestment campaigns, and historical and contemporary activism at WashU. Graded assignments will include scholarly essays, workshops, a bi-weekly notebook, and a group panel discussion..

Creators designed for these constraints, and their work then influenced the design of later hardware and software. This is a course about the history, design, and technology of one retro game console, the 1977 Atari Video Computer System (also known as the Atari VCS or the Atari 2600). The first popular home console, the Atari VCS is a truly weird computer: It ""boasts"" 128 bytes of RAM, no video buffer, and a custom graphics and sound chip designed to interface with then-universal cathode ray tube televisions. Against all odds, creators made fun and successful games within these extreme constraints. Just as an artist benefits from learning the fundamentals of their craft, so a game designer or developer can benefit from returning to these early and crude hardware platforms. In this course, students will learn the technical and creative history of the Atari, and they will also learn the fundamentals of programming its unfamiliar hardware. Students will carry out programming exercises, mostly in the assembly language instructions required to operate this unusual computer.

Creators designed for these constraints, and their work then influenced the design of later hardware and software. This is a course about the history, design, and technology of one retro game console, the 1977 Atari Video Computer System (also known as the Atari VCS or the Atari 2600). The first popular home console, the Atari VCS is a truly weird computer: It ""boasts"" 128 bytes of RAM, no video buffer, and a custom graphics and sound chip designed to interface with then-universal cathode ray tube televisions. Against all odds, creators made fun and successful games within these extreme constraints. Just as an artist benefits from learning the fundamentals of their craft, so a game designer or developer can benefit from returning to these early and crude hardware platforms. In this course, students will learn the technical and creative history of the Atari, and they will also learn the fundamentals of programming its unfamiliar hardware. Students will carry out programming exercises, mostly in the assembly language instructions required to operate this unusual computer. They will then make their own games for the Atari, which will be able to run on the actual, 45-year-old hardware.",HUM ,HUM ,HUM VC ,H ,HUM ,A,---R---,4:00P-6:50P,TBA,Bogost,No final,0,0,0

Throughout the history of Bond fiction, authorized and unauthorized writers have generated what now amounts to a threaded storytelling experience with pleasures that overlap with -- but are distinct from -- those of centrally planned media phenomena, like the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

And what happens when we consider that processes of extracting labor are inextricable from structures of racialized and gendered violence? We will begin with an investigation of the labor theory of value, situating it in relation to the marginalist revolution that took hold of economic thought during the second half of the nineteenth century and transformed subsequent understandings of value. We will then move into texts that feature various forms of compensated, under-compensated and uncompensated labor, forced labor, as well as practices of slacking, laziness, and refusal.Alongside Marxist-feminists such as Angela Davis, Silvia Federici, and Kathi Weeks, sociologists such as W.E.B Du Bois and Arlie Hochschild, and artists like Boots Riley and Margaret Atwood, we track the myriad ways in which feelings on and about the job-exhaustion, anxiety, but also playfulness, relief-can be conceptualized.

This course will investigate the following questions: What is disease? What is health? How do we classify disease? What counts as good evidence and good evidential reasoning in medicine? Is medicine a science? If so, what makes it distinctive as a science? What kinds of evidential roles do case studies play in medicine? How should we measure and compare outcomes in clinical trials and in systematic reviews? What is the appropriate relationship between medicine and the basic sciences or between medicine and the public health sciences (e.g., epidemiology, biostatistics, economics, behavioral science)? What role, if any, should private industry (e.g., the pharmaceutical industry, the health insurance industry) play in shaping the practice of medicine? How should we define and measure ""effectiveness"" in medicine? Do values inform decision making about health policy, and, if so, how? The overall goal of the course is to develop a reasoned, reflective approach to research and practice in medicine through the critical analysis of texts and case studies in the history of medicine. Students do not need a background in philosophy to take this course. This course is intended to be of special interest to pre-health professionals and to philosophy and science majors.

What role has medicine played in framing understandings about mental disorders and their management? During this course we will engage these questions, charting the shifting experience of mental illness roughly from the Middle Ages to the present.

1885,L85 MedH 3203,Bodies Out of Bounds: Feminist and Queer Disability Studies,3.0 Units,"For many, ""disability"" seems like a concept with a relatively stable definition and a fairly straightforward relationship to questions of health and well-being. But in the past few decades, scholars and activists have begun to challenge the notion that disability is a tragedy to be medically prevented or inspirationally ""overcome."" These scholars have instead focused their attention on the social aspects of disability: how it came to be constructed as a category of identity, the physical and institutional barriers that have excluded disabled people from public life, and the distortion of disabled lives within the mainstream representation. More recently, writers have turned their attention to the way disability had been defined though norms of race, gender, and sexuality. These intersections will be the focus of this course. From the diagnoses of hysteria, to debates over selective abortion, the recent proliferation of breast cancer memoirs, we will consider how the politics of disability has both complemented and complicated the usual goals of feminism. We will also explore some of the ways that disability studies as a discipline has redefined, and in turn been shaped by, the fields of queer theory, masculinity studies, and critical race theory. We will consider how deviant genders have been the target of medicalization, the relationship between ""corrective surgery"" and compulsory gendering, the desexualization and hypersexualization of disabled bodies, and the role that medicine has played in justifying colonial conquest and perpetuating racial inequalities. Pre: Any 100 or -200 level Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies course. Majors and minors in WGSS receive first priority.

This course taps into this particular evolution, prompting students to broaden their gaze to explore the often delicate relationship of people of African descent within the realm of medicine and healing. Tracing the social nature of these medical interactions from the period of enslavement through the 20th century, this course examines the changing patterns of disease and illness, social responses to physical and psychological ailments, and the experimental and exploitative use of black bodies in the field of medicine.

We will consider how much debates have changed from sixteenth-century Europe to 21st century United States by asking when, why and how either Medicine & Science or Religion influenced social thought and laws. Finally, we will consider how, and if, contemporary debates on vaccines are either part of the long history of debating bodily autonomy (as is the case with the other topics addressed in class), or if the conflict between religion, medicine and science in the modern era is new and distinctly different from past rhetorical strategies.

The course also analyzes from practical and real-world perspectives whether concepts such as war, human rights, democracy or various illnesses have the same meaning in different societies by considering the diverse frames of reference used by linguists, lawyers, anthropologists, and medical doctors across the world. Finally, we will focus on translation from a technological perspective by examining various modes of transfer of information required for the functioning of digital tools such as Google Translate, Twitter, Duolingo, or various Iphone applications.

Although often viewed today as a primitive forerunner of today's podcasts and audio-fiction, radio drama has had a long and storied tradition in German-speaking cultures. In this course, we will learn about the emergence of radio drama in the mid 1920s and explore how this art form developed in tandem with the social, political, economic, and technological transformations of the last century. Reading historical reflections by writers such as Bertolt Brecht, Walter Benjamin, Rudolf Arnheim, Theodor Adorno, and Klaus Schöning, we will interrogate how radio drama has responded to and shaped discourses on interpersonal communication in the modern age, fascist aesthetics, democratic subjectivity, collective memory, and questions of national identity and belonging. In studying radio dramas as both texts and sound documents, we will apply analytical tools from the fields of sound and media studies (including theories of listening and resonance) and transmedial narratology, and closely examine modes of adaption and techniques of acoustic staging. This seminar will also serve as an introduction to working with acoustic archival material and other historical media documentation. Radio Dramas include works by Walter Ruttmann, Günter Eich, Ingeborg Bachmann, Heinrich Böll, Frederike Mayröcker, Ernst Jandl, Heiner Müller, and Elfriede Jelinek.

2024,L16 Comp Lit 5652,Seminar: Romanticism and Modernism,3.0 Units,"Romanticism and Modernism are the two isms spanning the long turns of their respective centuries: 1789-1830 and 1880-1920. These periods may look like matching halves of a long history, but any understanding of the connectedness of the two historical periods is largely unformed and still unwritten in the literary and cultural criticism of both eras. The truth of that connective story motivates the narrative of this course. A totality of cultural history comes not through literature alone but in its conjunction with the arts of music and painting and a historically informed understanding of the politics. A special focus on the poetry in the literature and a prioritizing of revolution in political history will locate the main points of overlap and, in the end, offer the coordinates of an understanding of relationship and difference across the two periods and, more than that interconnectedness, the beginnings of a history altogether different to the existing ones. Call-and-answer is a rough formatting for the dialogue we wish to begin as we listen to the cultural texts of these two spots of crisis time, the two isms of their consecutive centuries echoing ahead and answering back. From the French Revolution through the Napoleonic Wars; from the later 19th century through the Great War into Revolutions not only in Russia after the 1914 war but also inside that war: these are the circumstantial parallels that establish the ground for comparative analysis in the historical force fields these two periods join in forming. Our topical locations include Feminism, Race and Empire, Poetry and the People, Poetry and Revolution, Experimental Poetics, the Gesamtkuntswerk or Total Work of Art as a utopian project and dystopian event, and the historicity of classical, romantic, modernist, and popular music.

The major purpose of the course is to gradually reveal how a city operates internally, and how it operates externally with its sister cities, surrounding metropolitan areas and neighboring states, amidst competing and often contradictory interests. Utilizing historical analysis as a guide, the course will briefly revisit the experiences of previous waves of ethnic groups to the St. Louis metropolitan area, as a lens for understanding the current social, political and economic dilemmas which many urban dwellers in St. Louis now face. The course will reveal to students the intricacies of social welfare issues and policies among high density populations, in St. Louis, that are homogeneous and heterogeneous, at the same time. Visits and discussions with various governmental and nongovernmental agencies, and how such agencies function or dysfunction for various constituencies allow students to ask crucial questions regarding equality of opportunity in a democratic society. Students will also encounter diverse communities and neighborhoods and the intended and unintended consequences of social welfare policies designed to ameliorate urban dilemmas such as poverty and inequality, homelessness, educational underachievement, gentrification, migration and immigration, development, health care, fiscal issues, the informal economy, and issues concerned with crime and social justice, among others. Readings are reinforced and challenged through visits, interactions and observations with broad constituencies and institutions, ranging from city officials to community residents. As such, this course offers a survey discussion of the rich interdisciplinary field of Urban Studies for those who may be interested in pursuing a stand alone major in the field of Urban Studies.",SC SD SSC ,HT SSC ,SSC ,S ,BA ,01,--W----,2:00P-4:50P,TBA,Camp Yeakey,No final,19,0,0

Some contend that memory sites are ""the new lunch counters,"" where our racial politics are worked out. This course examines the racial politics of commemorative objects and practices, and commemorative intervention as a strategy of anti-racist activism. We begin with an historical survey of various ways that racism has been inscribed on the commemorative landscape, and readings in history, political theory, cultural studies, and other fields to gain insight on these contested commemorative objects, their development, and social significance. We then turn to a critical assessment of efforts to remove and recontextualize commemorative objects, and to erect new objects commemorating neglected figures and issues. We consider how these reparative efforts relate to what political theorists call remedies of recognition, and specifically how they might aid in advancing equal opportunity and justice. Through our study and engagement with contested commemorative landscapes, including local, national, and global cases, students will become familiar with the burgeoning interdisciplinary field of memory studies, diverse forms and sites of commemoration, local and global efforts to advance what has been termed ""commemorative justice,"" and challenges they face.",HUM SC ,HUM ,CPSC HUM ,H ,BA ,01,---R---,3:00P-5:50P,TBA,Ward,Paper/Project/TakeHome,15,0,0

This course explores the design of and motivation for constructed languages from a modern linguistic point of view. Constructed languages are those that are the result of some conscious and deliberate design rather than ones occurring naturally. We will explore the different motivations for language construction, from the desire to create a ""perfect language"", to fictional world building, to fostering global harmony. In characterizing the different types of invented languages, students will develop familiarity with the basic tools of linguistic theory, focusing on phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics.

What are the causes, dynamics and consequences of international population movements? What are the key trends and patterns of migration in the major world region? How does migration trends form both destination and origin societies? What are the effects of migration and increasing ethnic diversity on national identity and politics? How has the Global North elected to manage the forced flow of people from the Global South? We will address these questions among others and survey the critical assessments of the policies whereby the host nations try to manage these flows and discourage mobility. The readings of the first weeks of the Spring semester - based on our main textbook the Age of Migration- will give us a profound understanding of the theories of migration, and empirical research from a variety of disciplines; namely Sociology, Political science, history, anthropology and geography. We will also have an opportunity to hear from some of the leading scholars and Journalists, lawyers specialized in international migration law...We will also watch short documentaries to get a closer sense of cases in the EU and MENA regions.

This is the period of an emerging cultural nationalism, a great efflorescence of literature in many genres, and some of the most important political, social, and military events in modern Irish history. One of the remarkable things about the period is the close relationship between prominent figures in the literary and artistic world and those in the realm of politics and social change. The result was a rich cross-fertilization of ideas and attitudes which had enormous implications for the future of this embattled island nation. We will explore this vital and transformative exchange by close attention to some primary texts of the period.

2099,L61 FYP 1140,Ampersand: The Biology of Cancer Part I,4.0 Units,"Cancer is the second-leading cause of death worldwide. In spite of focused research efforts, cancer still poses a unique biomedical puzzle as it is now recognized that cancer is not a single disease, but rather a collection of many disorders with underlying mechanistic complexities that can affect most tissues in the human body. This interactive 1st-semester course provides an introductory overview of the biology of human cancers. We touch upon background topics in DNA structure and replication, gene regulation and transcription, protein synthesis, mutations and DNA repair, but the primary focus is on the genetic and molecular changes that normal cells undergo during transformation into malignant tumors. Part I highlights the first three (of eight) central characteristics of cancer (known as the ""hallmarks of cancer"") - sustained proliferation, evasion of growth suppression, and replicative immortality. The course is a mix of lectures, student-led discussions/presentations, and activities. Lectures provide an overview of each topic, while activities and discussions of cutting-edge oncology topics in the news and primary literature familiarize students with current trends in cancer research as well as enhance reading and critical analysis skills. Students choose a specific topic/theme within the cancer paradigm for further study and near the end of the semester prepare a presentation to the class on its implications in the cancer universe.

However, these factors are insufficient to explain the political development of the Chinese state. It would be impossible to understand China's present without understanding its past. This seminar aims at understanding the origin and development of the Chinese state, and its consequences. In particular, we will achieve three objectives: 1. We will examine the origin and drivers of change in the Chinese state in different time periods; 2. We will understand how the past influences contemporary Chinese politics; 3.

Beginning in the 16th century, significant numbers of Chinese people moved to the frontiers of an expanding China and across its borders: to Japan and Southeast Asia, to the Americas and Australia, and to Africa and Europe. Although Chinese migration certainly existed beforehand, the period from the 16th century to the present day is marked by the emergence of sustained movement of non-state actors and the development of institutions -- ranging from native-place associations to tourist agents' websites -- that supported this vast circulation of people. Likewise, in many emigrant communities and host societies, Chinese diasporic families adapted to migration as a way of life.

And why are they problematic? In this course, we explore the creation and persistent representation of the Caribbean as a utopic place. We will examine texts like Shakespeare's The Tempest and Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, and watch clips from the Pirates of the Caribbean films to examine how the Caribbean was created in Western imagination. Against these representations, we will read the works of important Caribbean authors like Jamaica Kincaid, V.S Naipaul, Caryl Philips, Derek Walcott, Eric Walrond, and Claude McKay, and discuss how these authors have imagined and inscribed the Caribbean in their own vision as a contradictory, less-than-ideal place.",HUM ,HUM ,HUM ,H ,HUM ,01,M-W----,4:00P-5:20P,TBA,Payne,Paper/Project/TakeHome,19,0,0

From its colonization by Japan, to its suffering of a civil war within the cold war order, to its growth into a cultural and economic powerhouse, Korea's historical experience is at once unique and typical of that of a third-world nation. By immersing themselves in the most distinctive literary voices from Korea, students examine how the Korean experience of modernization was filtered through its cultural production. The course pays special attention to the writers' construction of the self and the nation. How do social categories such as ethnicity, class, gender, and race figure in the varying images of the self? And how do these images relate to the literary vision of the nation? Along the way, students observe the prominent ideas, themes, and genres of Korean literature. This class combines lecture with discussion, in which students are strongly encouraged to participate.

We will draw from the ""pen wars"" in the 1970's and reflect on the liminality of various Asian American writers caught between Asian and American loyalties. We will unpack real, fake and fabricated identities and discuss how identities have been historically shaped by race, gender, class, but are gradually moving beyond these categories into intersectional realities of selective racialization, desirable, and cosmopolitan Asianess. Utilizing the concept of ""racial formation"", the course will specifically interrogate four central dynamics of Asian American identity: the politics of Asian American scholarship, frameworks of Asian American representation, the task of the ethnic writer, and the liminal dynamics of New Asian American identities in the age of digitalization and social media.

2327,L46 AAS 423,Topics in American Literature: James Baldwin Now,3.0 Units,"Marking the centennial of his birth in 1924, this class will examine why James Baldwin became the twentieth-century African American author most loved in the twenty-first. An inexhaustible public witness and the author of poems, plays, essays, novels, and short stories, the Harlem-born Baldwin ranks with the most daring and elegant American literary voices. His first novel, the autobiographical ""Go Tell It on the Mountain"" (1953), wrestled with the dual heritage of Black Christianity and Depression-era Black social realism. His second novel, ""Giovanni's Room"" (1956), set in Paris and peopled with non-black characters, explored the intricacies of same-sex desire years before the Stonewall rebellion announced the gay rights movement. ""Notes of a Native Son"" (1955), the first collection of Baldwin's lush and searching essays and a grandparent of twenty-first century autocriticism, is perhaps the most-tweeted book of our era. Our reading list will contain all of these books, but we'll end with a sequence of texts revealing various facets of Baldwin's resurrected meaning in the wake of Black Lives Matter: among them, Ta-Nehisi Coates's memoir ""Between the World and Me"" (2015); Raoul Peck's documentary ""I Am Not Your Negro"" (2017); and Eddie Glaude Jr.'s Trump-era treatise ""Begin Again"" (2020). Altogether, this will be a single-author course on a singular author whose life after death illuminates crucial issues in Black cultural politics in two centuries.

""FOMO"" arouses worry about missing out on exciting events. ""Inferiority complexes"" illuminate fears of inadequacy. Although often unfounded, pathological fears known as phobias-from claustrophobia to xenophobia-structure perceptions of reality and inspire fear-driven fictional plots. In this course we will probe representations of fear-based obsessions, neuroses, and manias to understand not only how phobias permeate French and Francophone cultural production, but also to diagnose how they fuel the stories we tell about ourselves and others.

After a close reading of the entire text and a discussion of its major ideas, it's contextualized within the history of Buddhism and, more broadly, of East Asia, by examining its contributions to thought, ritual, literature and art in China, Korea and Japan, from its first translations into literary Chinese - the canonical language of East Asian Buddhism - to modern times. Topics covered include: the ontological status of the Lotus and, more broadly, of Mahayana scriptures; commentarial traditions on the meaning of the Lotus and its place within Mahayana Buddhism; practices associated to the worship of the Lotus - e.g., copying, reciting, burying; the worship of buddhas and bodhisattvas appearing in the sutra; Lotus-inspired poetry, and visual and material culture; Lotus-centered Buddhist traditions. Readings (all in English) are drawn from Buddhist scriptures and commentaries, tale literature, hagiographic narratives, poetry, archeological materials, and other literary genres. Given the importance that the Lotus has played in East Asia, this course functions broadly as an introduction to East Asian Buddhism. Previous coursework on Buddhism or East Asia is recommended but not required, and no prior knowledge of any East Asian languages is required.

2475,L27 Music 1225,"Race, Realism, and Representation from Madama Butterfly to Hamilton",3.0 Units,"In the Euro-American tradition, operas and musicals have long normalized the portrayal of (usually white) performers as characters of other races. Only in recent decades has the work of activists, performers, and scholars, pushed the cultural conversation to critique these practices as racist, exoticist, and culturally appropriative. On the live stage and on screen, music theater in recent years have paid careful attention to racially sensitive casting as a matter of restorative justice. We intuitively understand today that it is disrespectful for performers to portray themselves as characters of color outside their cultural background, but how has this relatively new idea come to be? How have performers of color engaged with this body of work over the past century? How have imagined narratives about the experiences of marginalized peoples affected the lives of the groups of people being depicted? Who has the cultural authority (or authenticity) to tell stories about others, and how has that authority been constructed and construed across different places and times? This course introduces students to the fraught and complex history of music theater in which performers portray racialized roles outside of their own identities. The syllabus pays particular attention to histories of music-theatrical yellowface as a racialized practice that - unlike brownface and blackface which have become taboo - continues to appear on performing arts stages today. Understanding the historical context in which these works arose and became popular, as well as analyzing the musical and dramatic techniques they utilized, can give us insight into their enduring legacy through to the present day. We will also complicate the easy rejection of this tradition by paying close attention to the history of people of color who, for the past hundred years, participated in, contributed to, and even loved, this body of work.",HUM SC ,HUM ,HUM VC ,H ,,01,-T-R---,10:00A-11:20A,Music Cls Bldg / 102   ,Wangpaiboonkit,Dec 17 2024  6:00PM -  8:00PM,25,0,0

2512,L27 Music 3015,American Popular Music and Media,3.0 Units,"This course examines diverse American popular music styles and genres in their historical and socio-political contexts. Following a rough chronology, the course centers African American musicians as creators and innovators of a vast range of music forms that make up the foundations of contemporary popular music in the United States and across the globe. We will consider the following questions: Does popular music in America merely entertain us, or does the music we listen to do something more and touch upon issues in our lives? Can it do both simultaneously? Can popular artists influence politics, or is that too much to ask of them?In order to address these and other questions, we will interrogate how musicians, performers, scholars, listeners, and consumers experience, participate in and think about various music and dance practices, from slave music and minstrelsy, the blues, jazz, and rock and roll to reggae and hip hop. Historically and through the present, we will consider how African American musicians, as well as musicians and performers from other underrepresented groups, have so often been excluded from reaping the economic and political benefits of music industries, and how they have contested injustice on multiple levels. This means that our core questions ask what musical practices can reveal about relations of race, gender, class and belonging in this country. Readings are drawn from the fields of musicology, ethnomusicology, popular music studies, and dance studies.

The major purpose of the course is to gradually reveal how a city operates internally, and how it operates externally with its sister cities, surrounding metropolitan areas and neighboring states, amidst competing and often contradictory interests. Utilizing historical analysis as a guide, the course will briefly revisit the experiences of previous waves of ethnic groups to the St. Louis metropolitan area, as a lens for understanding the current social, political and economic dilemmas which many urban dwellers in St. Louis now face. The course will reveal to students the intricacies of social welfare issues and policies among high density populations, in St. Louis, that are homogeneous and heterogeneous, at the same time. Visits and discussions with various governmental and nongovernmental agencies, and how such agencies function or dysfunction for various constituencies allow students to ask crucial questions regarding equality of opportunity in a democratic society. Students will also encounter diverse communities and neighborhoods and the intended and unintended consequences of social welfare policies designed to ameliorate urban dilemmas such as poverty and inequality, homelessness, educational underachievement, gentrification, migration and immigration, development, health care, fiscal issues, the informal economy, and issues concerned with crime and social justice, among others. Readings are reinforced and challenged through visits, interactions and observations with broad constituencies and institutions, ranging from city officials to community residents. As such, this course offers a survey discussion of the rich interdisciplinary field of Urban Studies for those who may be interested in pursuing a stand alone major in the field of Urban Studies.",SC SD SSC ,HT SSC ,SSC ,S ,BA ,01,--W----,2:00P-4:50P,TBA,Camp Yeakey,No final,19,0,0

It examines as well strategies for dealing with many of the profound social issues affecting urban/metropolitan America. Emanating from an historical perspective, it examines the ways in which industrialization and deindustrialization shaped Northern American cities and the consequences of deindustrialization on urban citizenry. It further surveys the demographic and spatial transformation of American cities examining the consequences of urban transformation on federal, state and local politics, on society and on her institutions. Similarly, the course focuses on the origin and societal changes and emerging goals of urban development, gentrification and evolving patterns of metropolitanism and the necessity for central city as well as neighborhood reconstruction. The dynamics of racial residential segregation, crime and punishment, issues of academic achievement and under-achievement, the social cleavages of urban marginalized communities, family structure, urban homelessness, urban sprawl, and health care, among others, are viewed from the perspective of social justice by exploring social, political, economic, racial, and ethnic factors that impact on access, equity and care. Various theoretical perspectives and philosophies are introduced that have dominated the discourse on race and urban poverty.

As such, schools are an institution deserving of rigorous scrutiny and careful interrogation. But in studying K- 12 schools, we are in fact attending to a multitude of things - competing visions of and purposes for schools, and disparate experiences of accessing and navigating education that are widely divergent along axes of inequality. In this course, which will be conducted as a discussion-based seminar, we will engage with texts examining the enterprise of education from varied vantage points, but always through a sociological lens. We'll discuss the varied purposes theorists and practitioners envision for schools, and the extent to which schools live up to those ideals. We'll talk at length about how schools are a microcosm of many of the inequalities we see in the broader society, looking at issues of race, class, gender, and place. By taking a sociological lens to studying education, we'll learn a language and facility for rooting discussion of issues in education in theoretical grounding and empirical evidence. In so doing, students will develop the capacity to more critically assess scholarly research and public discourses on education, as well as their own experiences.

This course considers politics across time, space, and individuals, noting how historical, geographical, cultural, social, psychological, political, and economic contexts can shape the politics of education. In addition, as this course considers the relationship between politics and power, we explore how politics can manifest itself in ways that promote exclusion and subjugation or work toward the common good. Finally, after carefully examining the research on inequalities and inefficiencies resulting from the current politics of education, we will transition from problem identification (i.e., ""What went wrong?"") to problem solution (i.e., ""Where do we go from here?"").

2685,L15 Drama 3015,Social Identity and Dramatic Character in Historical Practice,3.0 Units,"In everyday life, we present ourselves in different ways to different people. As we play different roles with family, friends, professors, and classmates, we shape ourselves differently in each context. We are also shaped by roles conditioned by race, gender, sexuality, and class. And the roles that we play and act out on social media add new complexities to the presentation of ourselves in everyday life. Sometimes these roles--perhaps those we share with our closest friends-seem truly authentic. And other times it may feel like we are wearing a mask. We can also consider roles played by other people in the past and across the globe, especially as they are imagined in the characters and roles created by playwrights and performance cultures from ancient Greece to the present day. Each historical theater, even the most ""realistic,"" considers dramatic characters positioned in relationship to other fictional characters, as they play out their respective roles. If there is a servant, there must be a master. If there is a lover, there must be a beloved. If there is a dissident, there must be an authority figure. The character arrangements, or ""systems,"" in theater and performance across space and time provide remarkable insights into the social relationships and social performances in each culture. And we learn that systems of class, race, gender, and sexuality are neither natural nor inevitable. This course examines the roles that dramatic characters play within the ""worlds"" of the play and performance culture they inhabit. In some cases, we can speak of metaphorical ""masks"" presented to the world; in others, the theater may use actual masks. We begin with classical antiquity, examining the differentiation of physical masks and characters in both tragedy and comedy (we will note that the word ""person"" comes from the Latin word ""persona,"" the word for mask in ancient Roman comedy). We then consider the complex system of types in classical Indian and later Kathakali dance-drama: types that each had specific emotions associated with them. Chinese musical theater of the fourteenth century, with strong ties to a rapidly growing urban environment, had its own distinct types. Following this unit we consider the masked characters of Italian Renaissance comedy (the commedia dell'arte) and its uncanny parallels to the nearby Karogöz, Turkish shadow puppet theater. We next move to the theater of Shakespeare, considering the boy actor and gender fluidity in Twelfth Night. Then we consider the ""realist"" playwright Ibsen, in view of the social roles performed by the play's characters. In Cloud Nine, Carol Churchill gives us insights into the performance of gender in modern life. A unit on modern and contemporary African drama examines the performance (or erasure) of political identity in crisis, as we read Athol Fugard's Sizwe Bansi is Dead and also the play Woza Albert! (Mtwa, Ngema, Simon). The course concludes with two African-American plays, August Wilson's Fences and Lynn Nottage's Sweat.

Direct engagement with ancient texts will encourage you to develop your own interpretations of, and written responses to, the political, social, and ethical manipulation that these mythological women were compelled to endure, and the subtle ways in which they appear to exercise power themselves. Selected scholarly articles and book chapters will help you contextualize these ancient dramas in their culture of origin. Because such issues continue to preoccupy both sexes today, you will see how Greek tragedy addresses perennial historical and cultural concerns through the examination of adaptations of Greek tragedies ranging from Seneca in ancient Rome to Spike Lee's Chi-raq.

2700,L15 Drama 4996,"Race, Memory, and Performance",3.0 Units,"This course takes as its starting point the vexing questions of history, memory, and identity that activists, scholars, artists, and others have posed in recent years. What is to be done with the commemorative landscape of monuments and memorials? How do we account for the silences and erasures in archival records? How should histories of racial violence be commemorated? These are questions that have been taken up in many arenas of civic life, including public art, ""living history"" tourism, museum studies, and urban planning. They have also been taken up by theater artists and performance artists who use their bodies, narrative, historical fact and, sometimes, fiction to bear witness to the past and to imagine new futures. In this course, we will examine the role of theater and performance in constituting-and challenging-the historically contingent meanings of ""race;"" we will also explore how performance of history shapes national narratives. Artists to be explored might include Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, Mary Kathryn Nagle, Dread Scott, Quiara Alegria Hudes, Simone Leigh, and Heidi Schreck. Artistic and/or performance experience is not required. Students will have the opportunity to propose their own commemorative projects; together we will explore whether and how performances of the past can do a certain kind of reparative work necessary for a more equitable future.",HUM SC ,HUM ,HUM VC ,H ,BA ETH ,01,-T-R---,1:00P-2:20P,TBA,McGinley,Paper/Project/TakeHome,19,0,0

The semester begins with a deepening understanding of psychological realism through the exploration of Anton Chekhov's plays. Focus then shifts to nonrealism with Harold Pinter. The second half of the semester is solidly rooted in nonrealism. Students hone their skills by exploring two more scenes from classical and/or contemporary texts. Additionally, in the final scene, students are encouraged to explore applicable considerations of gender-identity, race, and ethnicity in play and character selection.

This graduate seminar pairs critical theory readings about embodiment (and its attendant phenomena, including corporeality, kinesthesia, emotions, the senses, etc) with investigation into how specific artists work out such ideas in performance. Identity categories often marked by the body, including race, gender, and sexuality, will be particularly important. For example, we will wrestle with how ""the black dancing body"" as a conceptual framework maps (and not) onto the material realities of African American dancers. In addition to discussion of texts, in-class work includes embodied and creative exercises as a way for students to apply theory to practice. Assignments deepen students' artistry, help them develop analytical writing and presenting skills, and prepare them for professional work in both performative and academic arenas.",,,,,,01,-T-R---,10:00A-11:20A,Mallinckrodt / 326   ,Das,Paper/Project/TakeHome,12,0,0

It preserves some of the oldest known translations of the Bible, many apocryphal and ""heretical"" books that illustrate the wide diversity of ancient Christianity (e.g., the Gospels of Thomas and Mary), as well as sermons, saints' lives, monastic instructions, and liturgical manuals that still constitute the literary culture of the Coptic Orthodox Church today. In addition, a plethora of ""magical"" papyri illustrate medical and religious practices; personal letters reveal the lives of everyday people; and troves of business documents (e.g., contracts, wills, governmental petitions, receipts) have proved important for understanding Roman and Byzantine economies. Because Roman Egypt was a highly bilingual society, there are even instances of Classical Greek literature translated into Coptic (e.g., selections of Homer and Plato), and these offer a unique witness to how such texts were received by Egyptians.

We explore how while the post-9/11 context gave way to an increase in incidents of anti-Muslim violence, contemporary manifestations of Islamophobia are deeply rooted in state level anti-black racism from the early twentieth century, as well as in anti-Muslim attitudes that date back to the colonial period. By examining academic literature, political speeches, and news media sources, we situate Islamophobia within its historical context and also analyze how US anxieties about Islam and Muslims are not only gendered and racialized, but also exist across the political spectrum.",HUM LCD ,HUM ,HUM ,H ,ETH HUM ,01,-T-R---,10:00A-11:20A,TBA,Ali,Paper/Project/TakeHome,25,0,0

In dialogue with a transnational body of scholarship, political theory, as well as artistic and literary production, we will read about the following set of topics: slavery and abolition; race and racialization; empire and colonialism; third world-ism and nationalism; revolution and solidarity; ethnicity and nationality; migration and minorities. By studying how peoples of the region have debated issues of race and racialization, from the Abbasid era to the contemporary moment, we come to realize the legibility and urgency of race as an analytics in Middle East studies.

Its horizon stretches from the Muslim conquest of Iberia (al-Andalus) up to the turn of the 16th century when Spanish Jews and Muslims were equally faced with the choice between exile and conversion to Christianity. Until about 1100, Muslims dominated most of the Iberian Peninsula; from then onward, Christians ruled much and eventually all of what would become modern Spain and Portugal. Through a process known as reconquista (reconquest), Catholic kingdoms acquired large Muslim enclaves. As borders moved, Jewish communities found themselves under varying Muslim or Christian dominion. Interactions between the three religious communities occurred throughout, some characterized by shared creativity and mutual respect, others by rivalry and strife. The course focuses on these cultural encounters, placing them in various historical contexts. It will explore the ambiguities of religious conversion, and the interplay of persecution and toleration. Last not least, the course will address the question of how the memory of medieval Spain's diversity reverberates-and is utilized-in modern popular and academic discourse. All sources will be read in English translation; however, students are encouraged to make use of their linguistic and cultural expertise acquired in previous classes.

The course is threaded around a central organizing question: how can we feed a growing and more urbanized human population and conserve biodiversity without destroying the planet? We focus on the foundational biological principles involved in four main topics in the context of some contentious and confusing issues related to environmental biology in everyday life: human population growth, biological fluxes of carbon and energy in the ecosystem, biodiversity and conservation, and sustainable agriculture. The science literacy skills that are covered in this course help students face scientific and pseudoscientific claims about the environment and society in everyday life and will form the foundation for your development as a critical consumer of science information in the media. This course is taught in an active learning format utilizing reading homework before class to learn content and a mix of active student discussion and short lectures during class. Grades are based on homework, unit quizzes, and scientific literacy projects. This is an introductory course designed for first and second year students, though students of all years have found the course impactful and meaningful.

In spite of focused research efforts, cancer still poses a unique biomedical puzzle as it is now recognized that cancer is not a single disease, but rather a collection of many disorders with underlying mechanistic complexities that can affect most tissues in the human body. This interactive 1st-semester course provides an introductory overview of the biology of human cancers. We touch upon background topics in DNA structure and replication, gene regulation and transcription, protein synthesis, mutations and DNA repair, but the primary focus is on the genetic and molecular changes that normal cells undergo during transformation into malignant tumors. Part I highlights the first three (of eight) central characteristics of cancer (known as the ""hallmarks of cancer"") - sustained proliferation, evasion of growth suppression, and replicative immortality. The course is a mix of lectures, student-led discussions/presentations, and activities. Lectures provide an overview of each topic, while activities and discussions of cutting-edge oncology topics in the news and primary literature familiarize students with current trends in cancer research as well as enhance reading and critical analysis skills. Students choose a specific topic/theme within the cancer paradigm for further study and near the end of the semester prepare a presentation to the class on its implications in the cancer universe. Midterm Exams, which attendance is required, will be administered on Wednesday, October 16, 6:30 - 8:30 pm & Wednesday, November 20, 6:30 - 8:30 pm. Prerequisite: High school biology and chemistry, while completing AP or Honors biology is highly recommended.

Although often viewed today as a primitive forerunner of today's podcasts and audio-fiction, radio drama has had a long and storied tradition in German-speaking cultures. In this course, we will learn about the emergence of radio drama in the mid 1920s and explore how this art form developed in tandem with the social, political, economic, and technological transformations of the last century. Reading historical reflections by writers such as Bertolt Brecht, Walter Benjamin, Rudolf Arnheim, Theodor Adorno, and Klaus Schöning, we will interrogate how radio drama has responded to and shaped discourses on interpersonal communication in the modern age, fascist aesthetics, democratic subjectivity, collective memory, and questions of national identity and belonging. In studying radio dramas as both texts and sound documents, we will apply analytical tools from the fields of sound and media studies (including theories of listening and resonance) and transmedial narratology, and closely examine modes of adaption and techniques of acoustic staging. This seminar will also serve as an introduction to working with acoustic archival material and other historical media documentation. Radio Dramas include works by Walter Ruttmann, Günter Eich, Ingeborg Bachmann, Heinrich Böll, Frederike Mayröcker, Ernst Jandl, Heiner Müller, and Elfriede Jelinek.

Topics covered include: the ontological status of the Lotus and, more broadly, of Mahayana scriptures; commentarial traditions on the meaning of the Lotus and its place within Mahayana Buddhism; practices associated to the worship of the Lotus - e.g., copying, reciting, burying; the worship of buddhas and bodhisattvas appearing in the sutra; Lotus-inspired poetry, and visual and material culture; Lotus-centered Buddhist traditions.

The course pays special attention to the writers' construction of the self and the nation. How do social categories such as ethnicity, class, gender, and race figure in the varying images of the self? And how do these images relate to the literary vision of the nation?

Politicians further exploit the rise of extremist groups like ISIS to justify anti-Muslim rhetoric and critique multiculturalism, claiming that Islam and the West are inherently antithetical. In this course we examine the phenomenon of Islamophobia as a form of anti-Muslim racism that parallels hostility towards other religious and racial minorities in the US. We explore how while the post-9/11 context gave way to an increase in incidents of anti-Muslim violence, contemporary manifestations of Islamophobia are deeply rooted in state level anti-black racism from the early twentieth century, as well as in anti-Muslim attitudes that date back to the colonial period. By examining academic literature, political speeches, and news media sources, we situate Islamophobia within its historical context and also analyze how US anxieties about Islam and Muslims are not only gendered and racialized, but also exist across the political spectrum.",HUM LCD ,HUM ,HUM ,H ,ETH HUM ,01,-T-R---,10:00A-11:20A,TBA,Ali,Paper/Project/TakeHome,25,0,0

This course considers the role of religious thought and practice in such movements in the twentieth century. The history of these movements presents an apparent paradox: how can political action emerge from the supposedly ""private"" realm of religion in the modern era, particularly its most individualistic formations in contemplative and mystical practices? Does the historical role of these practices in the political sphere complicate their portrayal in some scholarship as private, individual, and depoliticizing? With these questions animating our investigations, we will consider the work of authors and activists including Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Martin Luther King, Jr., Simone Weil, and William Barber, as well as the history of movements associated with their work. Toward the end of the semester, we will turn to contemporary movements against economic inequality, intimate violence, racially motivated violence, and discrimination toward transgender persons to discuss the use of religious strategies or religiously-derived strategies in current political and social activism.",HUM ,HUM ,HUM ,H ,BA ETH ,01,---R---,3:00P-5:50P,TBA,Bialek,Paper/Project/TakeHome,12,0,0

Throughout the course, we examine how notions of gender and sexuality have changed over time and played various roles in the political and social life of Muslim nations, societies, and communities.

Our reading will extend from colonial community builders like Bilhah Franks, to early feminists like Rosa Sonneschein, to revolutionaries like Emma Goldman and reformers like Lillian Wald; from the philosopher Hannah Arendt to the labor leader Rose Schneiderman and the novelist Ayn Rand; from America's first woman rabbi, Sally Priesand, to modern-day leaders and celebrities like Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Judy Blume, Adrienne Rich, and Dianne Feinstein. Students will have the opportunity to conduct self-directed research as well as to try out creative projects and collaborative reflection. This course will teach students to thoughtfully analyze texts in historical context, to conduct sensitive conversations with generosity and curiosity, and to broaden their pantheon of American cultural giants.

How did this contemporary view of spirituality take shape historically?

Yet while writers and artists set out with a purpose-a clear vision and intention-those motives may change or evolve throughout the creative process. In Bird by Bird, for instance, Anne Lamott likens the writing process to ""watching a Polaroid develop."" As a writer, she claims, ""[y]ou can't-and, in fact, you're not supposed to-know exactly what the picture is going to look like until it has finished developing."" It is only after ""the portrait comes into focus, [that] you begin to notice all the props surrounding these people, and you begin to understand how props define us and comfort us, and show us what we value and what we need, and who we think we are."" Likewise, in At Work, Annie Leibovitz recalls staging the portrait of John Lennon and Yoko Ono in ""their apartment in the Dakota early in December"" of 1980. Initially, Leibovitz had a clear vision and mission in mind; she conceived of the photo as a moment of stolen intimacy: ""a simple kiss in a jaded time."" But everything changed in an instant-in the blink of an eye. That night, Lennon was shot and killed while returning to the Dakota. In retrospect, recounts Leibovitz, the portrait ""looks like a last kiss."" This is a course about stories and storytelling. What stories do we tell and what stories are we told?? How does art (written, visual, and performative) enable us to share our experiences-to bring purpose and meaning to our lives and to the lives of others? Throughout this course, we will explore these (and other) questions by drawing from a broad range of discourse communities, including (but not limited to) art history, sociology, psychology, film studies, and cultural studies. We will read, write, and share (both instructor and students) expository prose (personal, persuasive, and interpretative) to consider our perception of and place within the visual world.

Students will be asked to generate ideas for a variety of common forms-reviews, interviews, explainers, op-eds, short blog posts, topical think-pieces, etc.-and follow through the process of development from both sides. We will pitch and critique pitches, draft and curate, revise and re-structure, even collaboratively design social media publicity strategies.

3167,L13 Writing 3208,Imaginative Fiction: Science Fiction and Fantasy,3.0 Units,"In his introduction to McSweeney's Mammoth Treasury of Thrilling Tales, editor Michael Chabon laments, ""As late as about 1950, if I referred to 'short fiction,' I might have been talking about any one of the following kinds of stories: the ghost story; the horror story; the detective story; the story of suspense, terror, fantasy, or the macabre; the sea, adventure, spy, war, or historical story; the romance story."" Today, of course, if readers were to go looking for science fiction or fantasy stories (to say nothing of the other genres Chabon references) in their local bookstore, they would find them shunted to their own section, safely cordoned off from the aisles of ""mainstream"" fiction. In this course, we will examine, from a writerly perspective, the nature of that divide. Is it merited? Are science fiction and fantasy stories so fundamentally different in their construction from their conventional counterparts as to require a radically different approach, and if so, what unique devices do writers of imaginative fiction employ to set their stories apart? Our guide in this exploration will be Jeff Vandermeer's Wonderbook: The Illustrated Guide to Creating Imaginative Fiction, which we will be considering not just as an instruction manual, but as a representative text. How does Wonderbook-in its content, construction, and conceit-differ from more standard writing reference books? How is it similar? In what ways does Vandermeer's guide embody its subject matter? To aid us in this examination, we will be considering contemporary science fiction and fantasy stories by writers on both sides of the genre fence. The purpose of our reading is generative as well as illustrative. We seek to employ what we learn. There will be multiple writing exercises building towards a ten-to-twenty-page science fiction or fantasy story which students will submit to be workshopped by their peers in class. As a final project, students will revise their story and submit it along with their collected exercises and reading responses as part of their own Wonderbook.",HUM ,,,H ,,01,-T-R---,8:30A-9:50A,TBA,Rabong,Paper/Project/TakeHome,12,0,0

All of these skills are of use in fields well beyond publishing. Therefore, this class is for any student who wishes to know about such resources as usage guides (Garner, Fowler, Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of usage); dictionaries (the Oxford English Dictionary; Merriam-Webster); and manuals of style (Chicago, AP, MLA).

In addition to facilitating sleep and relaxation and its association with marriage and sexuality, the bed also is the centerpiece and likely the most expensive item of furniture item in the bedroom. Across cultures, from medieval Europe to imperial China, beds served as tokens of status that marked families' success and material wealth in increasingly commercialized and stratified societies. In the modern era, beds have drawn scrutiny from sociologists, sexologists, and social critics interested in questions of gender, family, and sexuality. A historical bed might also capture other meanings: its pathways through production, circulation, and consumption might illuminate global trading networks in lumber, labor, and finished commodities. It might reveal (or allow people to imagine) the transmission of craft knowledge, family formation, wealth accumulation (or dissipation), and social mobility. With these possibilities in mind, students will investigate and restore an antique Chinese wedding bed.

In grappling with these questions, students will directly engage with the texts through close reading and in-class discussion.

What does it mean to approach East Asia through a set of ""canonical"" texts?

It starts with objects in times of crises, from the matchlock guns which wreaked havoc across the Korean peninsula, to the ondol heated floors which warmed Korean homes through the Little Ice Age. Then, it delves into a period of cultural efflorescence, when new material cultures emerged, by the hands of Buddhist papermakers, up-and-coming chungin (""middle people"") painters, and aristocratic women. It ends with stories from the nineteenth century, when these ""Korean"" material cultures became closely entangled with their foreign counterparts-especially Western European-and how they were put on display at the world's fairs and expositions around the globe-in Japan, Chicago, Hanoi, and Paris. The overarching questions that run throughout the course are: What is material culture? How does the ""material turn"" change the nature of humanistic inquiry and expand the horizons of Korean/cultural studies? How may attention to ""things"" transform our understanding of the past and present, ourselves, and of the material world that we inhabit today?

After a close reading of the entire text and a discussion of its major ideas, it's contextualized within the history of Buddhism and, more broadly, of East Asia, by examining its contributions to thought, ritual, literature and art in China, Korea and Japan, from its first translations into literary Chinese - the canonical language of East Asian Buddhism - to modern times. Topics covered include: the ontological status of the Lotus and, more broadly, of Mahayana scriptures; commentarial traditions on the meaning of the Lotus and its place within Mahayana Buddhism; practices associated to the worship of the Lotus - e.g., copying, reciting, burying; the worship of buddhas and bodhisattvas appearing in the sutra; Lotus-inspired poetry, and visual and material culture; Lotus-centered Buddhist traditions. Readings (all in English) are drawn from Buddhist scriptures and commentaries, tale literature, hagiographic narratives, poetry, archeological materials, and other literary genres. Given the importance that the Lotus has played in East Asia, this course functions broadly as an introduction to East Asian Buddhism.

By immersing themselves in the most distinctive literary voices from Korea, students examine how the Korean experience of modernization was filtered through its cultural production. The course pays special attention to the writers' construction of the self and the nation. How do social categories such as ethnicity, class, gender, and race figure in the varying images of the self? And how do these images relate to the literary vision of the nation?

In its wake, the Hindu Right has brought violence against minorities; curbs on free speech; and moves toward second-class citizenship for Indian Muslims. This course will track the history of the Hindu Right in India from its 19th-century roots to the present. The struggle to come to grips with the Hindu Right is of immediate political relevance.

In addition to examining the Qur'anic discourse and early Islamic practices of slavery, to monitor change over time we address various forms of household, field, and military slavery as well as the remarkable phenomenon of ""slave dynasties"" following a chronological order.

What role does grace--or luck--play in the entire process?

Dada's emergence in Zürich and New York in the midst of World War I set the tone for its stress on irrationality as an oppositional strategy. Surrealist research into the domain of the unconscious continued this extreme challenge to dominant culture but in a revolutionary spirit that proposed new possibilities for personal and collective liberation.

We will begin our exploration of the concept of translation as a key mechanism of transmission between different languages by looking at works of literature, and film. Students will then examine how different cultures have historically required translation in their encounter with each other, studying how translation constitutes a necessary transcultural bridge both from a colonial and postcolonial point of view in different historical moments and parts of the world. The course also analyzes from practical and real-world perspectives whether concepts such as war, human rights, democracy or various illnesses have the same meaning in different societies by considering the diverse frames of reference used by linguists, lawyers, anthropologists, and medical doctors across the world. Finally, we will focus on translation from a technological perspective by examining various modes of transfer of information required for the functioning of digital tools such as Google Translate, Twitter, Duolingo, or various Iphone applications. Throughout the semester we will also examine a range of creative artworks, and various forms of digital technology and computing (AI, machine translation) related to the theory and practice of translation.

Some argue that state involvement in the economy hinders economic activity and development, while others argue for greater state involvement. Such arguments are often poorly informed by systematic rigorous research. We will look at some of the competing arguments about governments in failed and successful states and compare those arguments to the empirical world, or data.

And yet, few people in the United States have access to a clear and rigorous understanding of the Southern neighbor, often leading to conflict at the political and social levels.

A metaphorical representation of the human desire for control over the world at a time when everything was in chaos? We will focus our study on how Vergil adapts his Greek and Roman models, and especially the many various ways agriculture and myth are used in the poem to think about contemporary Rome. We will also learn how to save the bees. Please note, L10 494 is intended for undergraduate students only; graduate students may enroll in L10 5940.

Is medicine a science? If so, what makes it distinctive as a science? What kinds of evidential roles do case studies play in medicine? How should we measure and compare outcomes in clinical trials and in systematic reviews? What is the appropriate relationship between medicine and the basic sciences or between medicine and the public health sciences (e.g., epidemiology, biostatistics, economics, behavioral science)? What role, if any, should private industry (e.g., the pharmaceutical industry, the health insurance industry) play in shaping the practice of medicine? How should we define and measure ""effectiveness"" in medicine? Do values inform decision making about health policy, and, if so, how?

While its origins go back to the nineteenth-century (Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche), with even older antecedents, as a specific moment in the history of ideas existentialism was created in response to the ""age of anxiety"" from the end of World War I through the 1960s. It continues to ripple through to the present. We will explore the richness and depth of the canonic figures of existentialism. But we will also consider how that canon was itself shaped and what this entailed for how these thinkers have been understood. We will consider existentialist giants such as Sartre and Heidegger.

Western Civilization may be characterized as one long debate on the holy. In no other civilization did this debate about the limits of the sacred and the profane, this constant effort at trying to grasp the divine through word and deed, last continuously for over five thousand years. To argue over the holy is to argue over the very nature of how to live a life, from the most mundane daily activity to the most sublime act of the imagination. It is to argue over how politics, economics, art, philosophy, literature, and religion are realized in a society. Apart from many types of polytheism, we study the three great world monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. We study the ancient cultures of north Africa and the eastern Mediterranean, the empires of Alexander the Great and imperial Rome, the Christianization of the Roman empire and the rise of Islam, the early medieval world in the North Sea and the East (Byzantine) Empire in Constantinople, the formation of Latin Christendom and the papal monarchy, the crusades and the reaction of the Islamicate, concepts of individuality, the persecution of Jews and heretics, chivalry and peasant servitude, the Mongol Empire, the Black Death and the devastation of the fourteenth century, the renaissance in Italy and the Protestant reformation, the hunt for witches and the scientific revolution, the medieval origins of the African diaspora and the European conquest of the Americas. What defined being human, and so a man, a woman, or a child over five millennia?

Politicians further exploit the rise of extremist groups like ISIS to justify anti-Muslim rhetoric and critique multiculturalism, claiming that Islam and the West are inherently antithetical. In this course we examine the phenomenon of Islamophobia as a form of anti-Muslim racism that parallels hostility towards other religious and racial minorities in the US. We explore how while the post-9/11 context gave way to an increase in incidents of anti-Muslim violence, contemporary manifestations of Islamophobia are deeply rooted in state level anti-black racism from the early twentieth century, as well as in anti-Muslim attitudes that date back to the colonial period. By examining academic literature, political speeches, and news media sources, we situate Islamophobia within its historical context and also analyze how US anxieties about Islam and Muslims are not only gendered and racialized, but also exist across the political spectrum.",HUM LCD ,HUM ,HUM ,H ,ETH HUM ,01,-T-R---,10:00A-11:20A,TBA,Ali,Paper/Project/TakeHome,25,0,0

The history of these movements presents an apparent paradox: how can political action emerge from the supposedly ""private"" realm of religion in the modern era, particularly its most individualistic formations in contemplative and mystical practices? Does the historical role of these practices in the political sphere complicate their portrayal in some scholarship as private, individual, and depoliticizing? With these questions animating our investigations, we will consider the work of authors and activists including Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Martin Luther King, Jr., Simone Weil, and William Barber, as well as the history of movements associated with their work.

Readings (all in English) are drawn from Buddhist scriptures and commentaries, tale literature, hagiographic narratives, poetry, archeological materials, and other literary genres.

3355,L23 Re St 4060,"Conflict or Convivencia? Muslims, Jews, and Christians in Medieval Spain",3.0 Units,"This seminar will explore various facets of the coexistence (convivencia) of Muslims, Jews, and Christians in medieval Spain. Its horizon stretches from the Muslim conquest of Iberia (al-Andalus) up to the turn of the 16th century when Spanish Jews and Muslims were equally faced with the choice between exile and conversion to Christianity. Until about 1100, Muslims dominated most of the Iberian Peninsula; from then onward, Christians ruled much and eventually all of what would become modern Spain and Portugal. Through a process known as reconquista (reconquest), Catholic kingdoms acquired large Muslim enclaves. As borders moved, Jewish communities found themselves under varying Muslim or Christian dominion. Interactions between the three religious communities occurred throughout, some characterized by shared creativity and mutual respect, others by rivalry and strife. The course focuses on these cultural encounters, placing them in various historical contexts. It will explore the ambiguities of religious conversion, and the interplay of persecution and toleration. Last not least, the course will address the question of how the memory of medieval Spain's diversity reverberates-and is utilized-in modern popular and academic discourse. All sources will be read in English translation; however, students are encouraged to make use of their linguistic and cultural expertise acquired in previous classes. This course serves as the capstone seminar for Jewish, Islamic & Near Eastern Studies majors, Arabic majors, and Hebrew majors. Graduate students, minors, and other interested undergrads are likewise welcome.",HUM LCD ,HUM ,HUM ,H ,ETH IS ,01,-T-R---,2:30P-3:50P,TBA,Jacobs,Paper/Project/TakeHome,15,0,0
3356,L23 Re St 408,Nuns,3.0 Units,"Nuns -- women vowed to a shared life of poverty, chastity, and obedience in a cloistered community -- were central figures in medieval and early modern religion and society. This course explores life in the convent, with the distinctive culture that developed among communities of women, and the complex relations between the world of the cloister and the world outside the cloister. We look at how female celibacy served social and political, as well as religious, interests. We read works by nuns: both willing and unwilling; and works about nuns: nuns behaving well, and nuns behaving scandalously badly; nuns embracing their heavenly spouse, and nuns putting on plays; nuns possessed by the devil, and nuns managing their possessions; nuns as enraptured visionaries, and nuns grappling with the mundane realities of life in a cloistered community.",HUM LCD SC SD ,HUM ,HUM ,H ,BA ,01,-T-R---,4:00P-5:20P,TBA,Bornstein,Paper/Project/TakeHome,15,0,0
3357,L23 Re St 4141,"Gender, Religion, Medicine and Science",3.0 Units,"Have you ever wondered why some topics are argued using religion as a guide, while others may approach the topic from what is perceived as a strictly scientific point of view? This course explores how and why gender and sexuality tend to be at the center of debates that pit Medicine and Science against Religion. Using feminist and queer scholarship, this course explores five hundred years of rhetorical strategies related to defining, or regulating, gender and sexuality. We will consider how much debates have changed from sixteenth-century Europe to 21st century United States by asking when, why and how either Medicine & Science or Religion influenced social thought and laws. Finally, we will consider how, and if, contemporary debates on vaccines are either part of the long history of debating bodily autonomy (as is the case with the other topics addressed in class), or if the conflict between religion, medicine and science in the modern era is new and distinctly different from past rhetorical strategies. Prerequisite: Introduction to Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies. Majors and minors in WGSS receive first priority.

What are the social and political consequences of foregrounding spiritual seeking and religious experimentation over the ""organized religion"" of churches, synagogues, mosques, and temples? How did this contemporary view of spirituality take shape historically? The seminar focuses on a series of debates that have arisen over spirituality in American culture: the entwining of religious practices with consumer culture and corporate capitalism, the rise of therapeutic models of meditation and mindfulness, the politics of Euro-American appropriations of Native American and Buddhist religious practices, the implications of embracing religious variety and eclecticism, and the relationship between spiritual seeking and social justice.",HUM ,HUM ,HUM ,H ,,01,-T-----,3:00P-5:50P,TBA,Schmidt,Paper/Project/TakeHome,15,0,0
3359,L23 Re St 444,The Mystical Tradition in Judaism,3.0 Units,"What is Jewish ""mysticism""? What is its relationship to the category of ""religion""? Is Jewish mysticism just one form of a general phenomenon common to a variety of religious traditions or is it a specific interpretation of biblical, rabbinic, and other Jewish traditions? Taking the above questions as a starting point, this course aims at a systematic and historically contextualized analysis of a broad range of Jewish texts that are commonly classified as ""mystical"". (All primary texts are read in translation.) At the same time, we explore such overarching themes as: the interplay of esoteric exegesis of the Bible and visionary experiences; the place of traditional Jewish law (halakhah) within mystical thought and practice; the role of gender, sexuality, and the body in Jewish mystical speculation and prayer; the relationship between mysticism and messianism; Ashkenazic and Sephardic traditions and their mutual impact on Jewish mysticism; the ""absence of women"" from Jewish mystical movements; esoteric traditions of an elite vs. mysticism as a communal endeavor; and the tension between innovation and (the claim to) tradition in the history of Jewish mysticism.",HUM LCD ,HUM ,HUM ,H ,ETH IS ,01,-T-R---,11:30A-12:50P,TBA,Jacobs,Paper/Project/TakeHome,20,0,0
