278,B55 MKT 4095,Entrepreneurship Marketing Methods,1.5 Units,"Growing a startup requires sales and marketing strategies that are unique to those utilized by established organizations. This reality helps to explain why a scroll through LinkedIn or Twitter will likely introduce entrepreneurs to concepts such as ""product-led growth"" and ""flywheels."" It also explains why a search for ""startup marketing"" on Google will introduce them to ideas often referred to as ""growth hacks."" The challenge for founders as they work to apply these ideas is that they most often lack substance, specificity, and or actionable insight. These examples highlight the nuance of successfully marketing a startup, entrepreneurs' demand to learn these nuances, and the difficulty of correctly learning how to do the right things and do them well. These challenges are compounded by the fact that startups are resource- and time-constrained so they must learn how to prioritize driving customer acquisition, retention, and loyalty. Finally, startups must have a technology roadmap and measurement framework to optimize over time. This course will ensure that Olin students have this knowledge and expertise while also putting them in a position to help existing startups better grow their businesses. It is recommended that students take MKT 4095, offered as a Mini A course which will prepare you for the experiential course MKT 431E, Marketing Metrics, offered as a Mini B course where you will work with a real client on a specific growth initiative, applying what was learned in this course.

The origins of this field, often referred to as revenue management as it is also called, are in the airline industry during the late 80s. The prototypical question is how a firm should set and update pricing and product availability decisions across its various selling channels in order to maximize its profitability. In the airline industry, as most of us know, tickets for the same flight may be sold at many different fares, the availability of which is changing as a function of purchase restrictions, the forecasted future demand, and the number of unsold seats. The adoption of such systems has transformed the transportation and hospitality industries, and is increasingly important in retail, telecommunications, entertainment, financial services, health care, manufacturing, as well as on-line advertising, online retailing, and online markets. In parallel, pricing and revenue optimization has become a rapidly expanding practice in consulting services, and a growing area of software and IT development. The ultimate goal is for students to learn to identify and exploit opportunities for revenue optimization in different business contexts. The topics covered in the course are either directly or indirectly related to customer segmentation, demand modeling, and tactical price optimization.

349,B62 FIN 510,Introduction to Finance,0.0 Unit,"The main topics to be covered in this course are (1) principles of investments, (2) financial analysis of corporate projects, (3) cost of capital, and (4) capital structure and financing policies. The objective of the company is assumed to be shareholder value maximization. Shareholder value is created by earning more than the cost of capital. The cost of capital is an opportunity cost - what investors could expect to earn on comparable investments in the financial markets. To understand the cost of capital, we need to understand the viewpoint of investors. Furthermore, to understand whether a project earns more than the cost of capital, we need to know how to estimate and discount project cash flows. So, the first three topics are closely connected. The main question in the fourth topic is whether we can create shareholder value through the financial structure of the firm. For example, we will ask whether we can lower the cost of capital by financing with debt instead of equity, or vice versa. Course Goal: Prepare students for advanced coursework in finance, beginning in the Fall A term.",,,,,,01,TBA,,Remote / BUS   ,Sarkar,See instructor,0,0,0
