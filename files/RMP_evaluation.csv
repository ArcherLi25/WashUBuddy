1,Jianmin,Cui,4,1,Engineering,"One of the worst professors I have had at WashU. Very very boring lectures and homework is reading entire chapters of a long, dry textbook. His exam was very poorly worded and graded completely unfairly.

12,Hong,Chen,2,5,Engineering,"Excellent professor! Very passionate about what she teaches. The grading is fair and considerate. Your score reflects your understanding, and you final grade reflects your overall effort. She doesn't have all the answers to all your questions, but she's willing to learn and get back to you later.

14,Joe,Klaesner,4.4,2,Engineering,"First, our dean has stopped him from researching. For teaching, he is very uncaring, uses mostly outdated materials, and is very condescending to students. He does not use a clear rubric and takes off points because HE thinks the project isn't good, given HIS experience. Has the lowest score in official course evalutation of the entire eng school.",5,Rather not say,1,Tough grader--Graded by few things
15,Joe,Klaesner,4.4,2,Engineering,Dr. Klaesner didn't care about students. What he cares about is throwing tons of criticism into students' homework. He always got ready to read his lecture slides. There was no guidance/mentoring from him for students; what he did was simply introduce some basic concepts and read his boring grading rubrics. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED with his class.,5,Rather not say,1,Tough grader--Get ready to read
16,Joe,Klaesner,4.4,2,Engineering,He looked so confused when our group was presenting the final presentation. No idea about what I learned from this class. ,5,C,1,Tough grader--Get ready to read--Lots of homework
17,Joe,Klaesner,4.4,2,Engineering,His senior design class is not helpful for me to get insights into professional ways of developing an engineering product. The only few things I learned are to find a client and define the problem...,5,Rather not say,1,Tough grader--Get ready to read--Lots of homework
18,Joe,Klaesner,4.4,2,Engineering,"Prof Klaesner knows ~a lot~ about circuits and electronics. He cares about the students a lot and even though he rambles a little bit, its with the intention of explaining applications of what you're learning. He also does a ton for getting students internships and is very personable if you just strike up a conversation. ",2,A+,4,
19,Joe,Klaesner,4.4,2,Engineering,"Absolutely ridiculous professor. He and his TAs are extremely disrespectful to students, throwing out suggestions in very condescending ways. TAs are helpful at the very least and Dr. Klaesner is neither helpful nor respectful. I also know from my peers that no one thinks he is a good teacher and most of us agree with his absurdity.

25,Kurt,Thoroughman,4,2,Engineering,"I don't think I actually fully learnt any new material in his class- reads off the textbook during lecture, doesn't explain things when we try to ask him questions, and the material covered in class doesn't prepare us for homeworks/midterm quiz/final exam at all.",4,,1,
26,Kurt,Thoroughman,4,2,Engineering,The BME circuits class is a joke.,1,A,1,
27,Kurt,Thoroughman,4,2,Engineering,"Returns 0 grades. Does not answer questions at all. Refuses to write anything on the board, not even working out problems. Lectures are disjointed, eclectic, and often irrelevant. Entire course based on a random professor's lecture notes from a different school- not even a BME class. Cool guy, really passionate, good lab section, otherwise not good",4,A,1,Graded by few things--Lecture heavy
28,Kurt,Thoroughman,4,2,Engineering,"I was originally excited to take the new BME circuits course but was majorly disappointed once the class began. The lectures made no sense and left me more confused than ever before. No example problems were ever worked out in class, even though our final and homework consisted of working out problems. The grading is also ambiguous.",4,Not sure yet,1,Graded by few things--Hilarious
29,Kurt,Thoroughman,4,2,Engineering,"WORST PROFESSOR IVE EVER HAD. This man belongs in a research lab, not a classroom. Im sure he knows about circuits, but he has zero inability to pass that knowledge to anyone else. He also doesn't grade homework for months!! WashU needs to seriously reconsider his teaching position. Take ESE230 instead to actually learn something. Overall terrible.",4,,1,Graded by few things--Lecture heavy
30,Kurt,Thoroughman,4,2,Engineering,"Thoroughman is the absolute worst professor Ive ever had. He rambles on about things that arent related to the material, chastises students for not knowing things he didnt teach, and throws a full-on hissy fit if someone asks him for an example of what hes talking about. I am leaving BME because of this man, and I hope WashU fires him.",5,A,1,
31,Kurt,Thoroughman,4,2,Engineering,super hard class but thoroughman is a really great guy who wants the best for his students.,5,A+,5,Gives good feedback--Respected--Accessible outside class
32,Kurt,Thoroughman,4,2,Engineering,BME220 is a very interesting class. It gave me a new perspective on the college education system while giving me no new insight on circuits. We spend 80k to for a carbon copy of another professors website. Classes consist of rambling that nobody understands. When asked for examples he aggressively refuses and short circuits. Please do not take!!!!!,4,Not sure yet,1,Graded by few things
33,Kurt,Thoroughman,4,2,Engineering,DONT TAKE BME 220. That class is a joke. Just take normal circuits. Thoroughman is very vague in his lectures. Honestly you could probably learn more by reading a textbook. He teaches entirely from a webpage from another professor from Harvey Mudd. The only time anyone actually learns anything is from the labs.,4,,1,
34,Kurt,Thoroughman,4,2,Engineering,He teaches the brand new bme 220 class and is an actual disaster. He cant even come up with his own notes he stole a professor from Harvey Mudds notes and refuses to accept any criticism from the class. No body has any idea whats going on. Take normal circuits.,4,,1,
35,Kurt,Thoroughman,4,2,Engineering,Intro to BME is a joke. The lectures do not matter. I have attended them all and none of them relate to the material on the test. The homework also has no correlation to the test. You go in and try to bs your way through the exam and hope he likes what you wrote down.,5,,1,
36,Kurt,Thoroughman,4,2,Engineering,"Such a hard class, but he knows it. He's not a bad guy, but this class is meant as a weed out class. He does care about students, the material is just insane for a freshman.",5,,2,
37,Kurt,Thoroughman,4,2,Engineering,"This class is hard because it is meant to be hard. Be sure to use the PST leaders as much as you can on the homework because you won't make progress without them. He guides you on what to study for exams. Pay attention to the things he repeats because they will be tested. This was my hardest class of the semester, but my far the most interesting.",4,A+,2,
38,Kurt,Thoroughman,4,2,Engineering,"The most energetic lecturer I've had.  Great at engaging students, very entertaining.  Brilliant and very passionate about his portion of QP.  He's helpful with specific questions and explains CLabs well.",5,,4,
39,Kurt,Thoroughman,4,2,Engineering,previous post may be ironic; he did not hold any office hours and was very unhelpful.,1,,1,
40,Kurt,Thoroughman,4,2,Engineering,Very animated professor. Not entirely understandable at all times but definitely very helpful outside of class. The class itself was challenging yet interesting. Got 4 credits to spare&#63; Take BME301A!,4,,2,
41,Chao,Zhou,4,2.8,Economics,Every lecture is the exact same information as the chapter.  The class wasnt that hard.  She provides a lot of extra credit with practice tests.  The exams are pretty much the same as the practice tests.  The only bad thing was attendance is mandatory and she requires participation as a part of the grade.,2,,3,
42,Chao,Zhou,4,2.8,Economics,"Worst teacher ever. You cannot understand her. All she does is read the powerpoint presentations out loud, and does not explain anything! If you have the choice, do not choose her.",5,,2,

44,Rohit,Pappu,4,2.5,Engineering,"Everything people say about Pappu is true. No body learns everything, everyone gets A's, etc. By far the most condescending prof I've ever had.

50,Rohit,Pappu,4,2.5,Engineering,Dr. Pappu is very condescending and appears non-interested in teaching. He's apparently mad that he couldn't get into med school or something (he vaguely mentioned this to one of his prior lab member),3,A-,1,

52,Rohit,Pappu,4,2.5,Engineering,"Simply put, he doesn't really care. There's a reason that his exams are a joke. He's pretty condescending to students on multiple occasions. But, it's quite an easy A if you put in the work.",2,A,3,Respected--Clear grading criteria--LECTURE HEAVY
53,Rohit,Pappu,4,2.5,Engineering,Judge it yourself. He said in front of the class that he would give an A to a student who would beat a student who unfortunately gave a wrong answer. That's a Wash U professor!!!!!!,5,,1,
54,Rohit,Pappu,4,2.5,Engineering,"Great Professor. Although material he teaches in this class is tough, Dr. Pappu makes tests and quizzes so easy. He is extremely helpful during his office hours too. Such an easy A class.",2,,3,

Overall, I did not gain an understanding of Thermodynamics from this class.",4,,1,
59,Patricia,Widder,3.8,5,Engineering,"Prof Widder is the sweetest person ever and is very respected in the department. She gives good lectures that are easily understood.

Very kind, flexible and willing to help.  Does lots of example probs. Says what is on tests.  Also, either I'm really bad at phasing questions or there is a bit of a language barrier.  He needs to work on his accent. ",3,,2,

The exams were not reflective of lecture materials.,5,B,3,Tough grader--Amazing lectures --Lots of homework
1069,Jay,Turner,3.4,4.5,Engineering,Prof Turner has a super interesting job that he talks about a lot because it has to do with the class.

He makes Reactions interesting and Unit Ops less stressful.,3,,5,Gives good feedback--Inspirational--Group projects
1087,Kimberly,Parker,2,4,Engineering,Dr. Parker's class is a good overview of environmental engineering topics. She is very accessible and wants everyone to understand the material.

Any math professor that spends 20 minutes arguing about how to solve for sin (opp/hyp) telling the class its (adj/hyp) should NOT be teaching.

4515,Silas,Johnson,3.4,4.9,Mathematics,Prof Johnson is amazing. He's the absolute perfect prof for the calc 1 calc 2 sequence because he teaches the most important fundamentals of calculus that will help you later on in math.

Although the weekly homework was hard, he was very accessible at office hours and would help you through work without just giving you the answer.

5077,Tiffany,Lang,2.6,4.5,Communication,"Tiffany speaks very fast, but tells you EXACTLY what you need to do to pass the speeches and tests.  No surprises.  When answering questions she sometimes talks down to students, that was my only complaint about her. GO TO CLASS, don't make excuses and do EXACTLY what she says and you'll be fine.",2,,5,
5078,Tiffany,Lang,2.6,4.5,Communication,I was not a huge fan of this women.  I found her to be sarcastic and rude and I felt like she had a tendency to talk down to her students.  If I had to take the class again I would choose a different teacher.,5,,3,

5080,Tiffany,Lang,2.6,4.5,Communication,"I have read some of these comments on here, and I have to say that some are not true. I'm talking about those who complain about how much time they get to write a speech or even clarity. Now clarity is thier own opinion, but if two weeks isn't enough time to write a 4-6 minute speech, then you aren't going to get it done at all.",2,,5,
5081,Tiffany,Lang,2.6,4.5,Communication,"Mrs. Phillips is not only a teacher that you can talk with, but her class is interesting aswell. This was my first year taking college courses and I'd have to say that I was lucky that I ended up in her class. She isn't one of those teachers that gives you information and then gives you a totally different final. She knows how to teach.",3,,5,
5082,Tiffany,Lang,2.6,4.5,Communication,She is a good teacher. She is strict about deadlines and attendance but is informative and helpful. She preps you well for tests and helps those nervous about speaking. I feel like a better speaker for having taken her class,3,,5,
5083,Tiffany,Lang,2.6,4.5,Communication,"Good teacher, however, is VERY strict on attendance. I know they are dept rules but it is her choice to enforce it. I haven't had any other teacher be so hard on absences. A bit sarcastic, speaks very fast, and a bit rude at times. Class was very easy though and has good class activities.",1,,4,
5084,Tiffany,Lang,2.6,4.5,Communication,Great teacher. She is very helpful in answering questions. Four major speeches in the class.,4,,4,
5085,Tiffany,Lang,2.6,4.5,Communication,Ms Phillips is a very good teacher. She takes her job very serious and is willing to help those who are willing to ask. At times she can be a bit sarcastic & extremely to perky but overall I was satisfied with the class.,2,,5,
5086,Tiffany,Lang,2.6,4.5,Communication,"I thought she spoke too fast and the speech dates dont really give us enough time. Although, everytime i've ever asked anything she was always willing to help and was clear with things.",3,,2,
5087,Tiffany,Lang,2.6,4.5,Communication,She walks everyone through the speech process and has fun exercises to get everyone use to the idea of talking in front of the class.  I have never been bored in her class and at the end of the class you feel like you know everyone.  I would definately take this class again!!!,3,,5,
5088,Tiffany,Lang,2.6,4.5,Communication,"She is helpful, but not so realistic in my opinion.",1,,5,
5089,Tiffany,Lang,2.6,4.5,Communication,"Tiffany knows her subject amazingly well for as young as she is - very qualified with degrees, and lots of real world experience as well.  She is strict with attendance and such, but those are rules she's enforcing from the department.  I recommend that if you take COM, take it from Tiffany.",4,,5,
5090,Tiffany,Lang,2.6,4.5,Communication,"Tiffany is a great teacher. Friendly, approachable and has great controll of the classroom. she allows everyone their time for comments but tries not to let one person blabber on, keeps the class moving. she is very open about being available for help and returns phone calls and emails quickly. uses powerpoint minimally and keeps the class fun.",3,,4,
5091,Tiffany,Lang,2.6,4.5,Communication,"Tiffany is a great teacher but she is a stickler on attendance!!! You will lose 50 points if you miss one class, that can drop your grade down from an A to B.  I don't feel that is appropriate if you do A work and you have 1 or 2 absenses, i understand if they are out of hand. KEEP THAT IN MIND!!!",1,,5,
5092,Tiffany,Lang,2.6,4.5,Communication,Ms. Phillips is a young teacher. She is passionate about what she teaches. Four speeches. Not too hard. Makes Communications more relaxed and not so tense. Overall Great teacher.,3,,3,

5094,Tiffany,Lang,2.6,4.5,Communication,"Makes a boring subject fun. If you have to take this class, take her. She grades fair. You have to do 4 speeches and that's the hardest thing you'll do in the class.",1,,5,

5097,Michael,Landis,1,4,Sociology,"hes fairly easy, but he does give out random quizes on random days, so you should kinda show up to discussion. Tries to engage the class with questions but if the class does not respond he will just stand there until someone says something, kind of awkward!",1,,4,
5098,Allan,Larson,3.3,3,Biology,Didn't get a single grade back until the end of the semester. Received final grades WEEKS into the NEXT semester. Extremely unfair and biased grading. Lectures consisted of him going on random tangents. The readings were barely explained. Absolutely NEVER take a class with him. It felt like a complete waste of time and I Iearned basically nothing. ,4,,1,Tough grader--Lecture heavy--Graded by few things
5099,Allan,Larson,3.3,3,Biology,Took in Spring 2022. Cares a lot about the topics but at times is tangential in lecture and the content can be very repetitive in general.

You really have to make the effort! His tests aren't hard; he gives you all the materials you need to do well both on the test and in lecture--but they ARE long.",4,,5,Accessible outside class--Get ready to read--Skip class? You won't pass.
5102,Allan,Larson,3.3,3,Biology,I had him for molecular evolution. The concepts were poorly taught and Dr. Larson seems to have a tough time articulating what he means. The importance of concepts compared to one another was completely unclear. The course was only made more confusing when he told us to disregard parts of our reading in exchange for his contrary ideas.,4,,1,TEST HEAVY--GRADED BY FEW THINGS--LECTURE HEAVY

5104,Allan,Larson,3.3,3,Biology,"His lectures are incredibly boring and he repeats the same thing over and over with different words. He often starts sentences and doesn't finish them. I stopped going to class because I couldn't pay attention during his lectures. He's the easier professor, but I enjoyed Duncan's section more because it was  interesting.",2,A,2,
5105,Allan,Larson,3.3,3,Biology,"Larson's part of 2970 is the reason I got an A, just memorize how to answer his questions and you'll be fine. Stats should really be a prereq for this class, I had no idea what poisson distributions or statistical parameters were when I was in the class and it made the content very difficult to understand, I was just going through the motions. ",2,A,2,
5106,Allan,Larson,3.3,3,Biology,"Larson is an extremely slow lecturer but cares about his class. 100000x better than Duncan, which isn't saying much. ",5,,4,
5107,Allan,Larson,3.3,3,Biology,"Larson is a pretty boring lecturer, not going to lie. However, he definitely has good intentions; he patiently answers questions in lecture. The material for this second half of the course was a lot of calculation and understanding parameters, which I thought was confusing and not clarified in lectures a lot of the time.",4,A,2,
5108,Allan,Larson,3.3,3,Biology,"It seems like he's trying to teach well, but the class is extremely boring and usually poorly motivated. I came out understanding very little of why we were doing the calculations we were doing.",2,,1,
5109,Allan,Larson,3.3,3,Biology,Professor Larson is a nice guy but his lectures are very boring and drawn out since he speaks very slowly. Just watch the videos online at 2x speed. Pretty easy exams compared to Duncan's half but averages are way higher so you have to do even better to beat the mean.,2,,2,
5110,Allan,Larson,3.3,3,Biology,"Overall a good teacher who is very knowledgeable in evolutionary biology. The material definitely gets a little dry, but it's not too bad. His material is also way easier than Duncan's, so it's a nice change of pace when he starts teaching. Do the problem sets, old exams, and memorize terms and you'll do fine.",2,,4,
5111,Allan,Larson,3.3,3,Biology,"Textbook use was low, but overall as long as you do the practice problems and practice exams, you should be able to do well on the tests.",2,,3,
5112,Allan,Larson,3.3,3,Biology,"Cares about his students. (He sent the whole class an email because some girl left behind a hairbrush--haha.) But his lectures are VERY boring. He tends to be slow and wordy. It is amusing when he gets so excited about biology. Learn the definitions and do the old exams. 3rd exam mean is high, which makes it hard to do well (z-score wise).",2,,2,
5113,Allan,Larson,3.3,3,Biology,"The material is not the most interesting (sometimes boring), but Larson really cares about the class/subject and is a really nice guy!  His exams are very easy, and I definitely learned a lot in this class.",2,,3,
5114,Allan,Larson,3.3,3,Biology,"His lectures notes were a bit disorganized as one has to jump from notes on the board to notes on the powerpoint to notes that he states but that are not written down anywhere.  If you pay close attention during lecture, however, you can grasp the concepts.  The exams are extremely easy and he reuses questions.",1,,4,
5115,Allan,Larson,3.3,3,Biology,Great Professor. Very reasonable teacher. Tests come straight from the notes. Great class.,1,,4,

5117,Allan,Larson,3.3,3,Biology,"Although he has a monotone, he is one hundred times than whoever teaches the first part of the course. He is very clear about what he is saying and tries to incorporate philosophy, geology and history into biology, which is very educational.",1,,5,
5118,Allan,Larson,3.3,3,Biology,"He taught the second part of the course, which is significantly easier than the first part. Not the most interesting material in the world, but he tries. He's also pretty boring, but he does have his moments. He cares about the subject and his students.",2,,5,
5119,Allan,Larson,3.3,3,Biology,"Nice guy, but a medicore teacher.  While sometimes interesting, his lectures often suffered from a monotone delivery and abstruse terminology and definitions.  His exam questions were much easier than those of Duncan.",2,,3,

It's amazing to learn about the true origins of the atomic and molecular wave functions.  111 has a bad reputation of being a weed-out course...couldn't be further from the truth.  Loomis does aim for low means, but broad distributions.  He does not normalize, but his means are a mid B.",4,,5,

Her study guides are easy for this class, but DON'T take her for Intro to Mass or Research methods. She's a nice person and likes to bring out discussion in the class. Take her for this one! And BUY THE BOOK.",4,,3,
8414,Danielle,Williams,3,3.7,Freshman Seminar,"She is a very nice person, but is very unclear when giving presentations. Most of the test cover what is in the book, so taking notes is almost pointless. She goes off on tangents a lot of the time, & does not complete her thoughts through out the class.I only showed up b/c I had to. You basically teach yourself.",2,,2,
8415,Danielle,Williams,3,3.7,Freshman Seminar,"I LOVED Prof. Williams classes! It was one of the only classes I actually looked forward to going to. Most of her information was straight out of the book, and she provided extensive study guides for the tests. She was super nice and super helpful, and when I had a family emergency in the middle of the semester, she was very accommodating.",2,,5,
8416,Danielle,Williams,3,3.7,Freshman Seminar,"Her other classes are much harder than this one, probably because of the material. She LOVES facilitating conversation, which is a lot of fun in this class. It's centered around participation, not around grading (though there are tests and papers). If you're going to take her, take her for THIS class. It's much easier, more enlightening, and fun!",3,,5,
8417,Danielle,Williams,3,3.7,Freshman Seminar,"She's a nice person and she tries her hardest to keep her class interesting. He tests are SO hard, but if you study the TEN PAGE STUDY GUIDES, you'll get an A. Or maybe a B. She knows her stuff when it comes to researching because she's doing it right now for her doctorate... she's super scatterbrained tho. So that can get annoying.",4,,4,
8418,Danielle,Williams,3,3.7,Freshman Seminar,She makes the classes very interesting and the papers aren't painful once you figure out how she grades. She picks relevant topics to talk about during class and be prepared for discussions for class. She also puts out study guides that are pretty helpful if you fill them out.,2,,5,
8419,Danielle,Williams,3,3.7,Freshman Seminar,"Research Methods is not an easy class, but she makes it as interesting as possible.  She does not teach the class like we are research scholars so her papers are not as long as some other professors.  She does take off for spelling and grammar so proof read.  Gives xtra credit opportunities. Take advantage - it could make the difference in passing",3,,5,
8420,Danielle,Williams,3,3.7,Freshman Seminar,"This teacher starts out ok, but is just not great. Her grading scale doesn't match up with the letter grade it is assigned to. Her tests are way too hard. She does offer extra credit. For an Intro. to Mass Comm class, her expectations are too high and unrealistic. She is very scatter brained, and has a hard time formulating ideas & thoughts.",4,,3,
8421,Danielle,Williams,3,3.7,Freshman Seminar,"She is a nice person, but if you don't do an assignment or don't show up for class one day without a good reason, she can be rude. I don't think she intends to do it. She grades down to the smallest detail. Overall not the worst teacher you can get.",3,,5,
8422,Danielle,Williams,3,3.7,Freshman Seminar,"I think she's a great professor to have. I have her for the media version of the KSU seminar. We spend a lot of time watching TV Shows/movies/clips. She's extremely helpful and goes out of her way to make sure she can help you in any way. She's very friendly, and makes corny jokes you cant help but laugh at. I'd say to take her class.",3,,5,
8423,Danielle,Williams,3,3.7,Freshman Seminar,The material isn't too exciting or interesting. She is a film major so she does talk about movies and t.v. shows a lot. Class gets out early a lot. The research paper isn't hard; it's on your career choice. The speech is on a t.v. show or movie or video game.,2,,5,
8424,Danielle,Williams,3,3.7,Freshman Seminar,Very Boreding class!! Hated going maybe it was because at 5pm. Doesnt put power points online so u must attend class. Have to write a reseach paper and give a 6 min speech. Lots of random annoying assigments. Read the book and u will be fine,2,,3,
8425,Danielle,Williams,3,3.7,Freshman Seminar,She was an ok teacher. Class was really boring but you expect that with a KSU class. she is a tough grader. Make sure you turn in everything on time. Sometimes she will take things late. You don't really need to study for test just make sure you are in class the day before the test becasue you will do some type of a review,2,,4,
8426,Danielle,Williams,3,3.7,Freshman Seminar,"she is the WORST grader, she takes off lots of points on papers for irrelevant things...besides that she is OK.

8429,Danielle,Williams,3,3.7,Freshman Seminar,she's alright. go to class and read what she asks you to read and you'll be alright. The class is super boring so bring a book or something. the final is pretty hard though so study up for that one.,3,,4,
8430,Danielle,Williams,3,3.7,Freshman Seminar,She's not a bad teacher. She loves discussion about anything. So just sit back and  discuss; study the notes she gives and you'll be fine. Give her writing assignments at least half the attention you would your English papers and you should do good on those. If you don't get an A it's completely your fault.,1,,4,
8431,Danielle,Williams,3,3.7,Freshman Seminar,"The person that rated her poorly probably didn't do anything. This was one of my easiest classes. She's more than willing to help anyone, she's very outgoing and friendly and lots of fun to be around.

8434,Danielle,Williams,3,3.7,Freshman Seminar,"Hard class, but teacher's nice, grades hard even though u have 20pts built in, but the best thing is he prepares u for the final. The final was so easy.
