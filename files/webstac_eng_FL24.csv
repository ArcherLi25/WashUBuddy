Reverse engineering -- the process of deconstructing an object to reveal its design and architecture -- is an essential skill in the information security community. Although hackers often use reverse engineering tools to discover and exploit vulnerabilities, security analysts and researchers must use reverse engineering techniques to find what a specific malware does, how it does it, and how it got into the system. In this course, we will explore reverse engineering techniques and tools, focusing on malware analysis. Students will use and write software during in-class studios and homework assignments to illustrate mastery of the material.

One is to teach students -- via lectures, reading assignments, homework and exams, to think on their own, to solve problems, and how engineering principles are applied to the areas of bioelectricity, biomechanics, biomolecules, biotechnology, and bioimaging. The second is to introduce students, via guest lectures by school of medicine and engineering faculty, to some of the fascinating and challenging ongoing research in these areas. By the end of the course students will have begun to acquire the skills and approaches necessary to succeed in the engineering curriculum as well as a much more in-depth and informed perspective of BME.
